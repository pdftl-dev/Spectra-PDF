"""The Ghent PDF Output Suite 5.0 gate.

INTERNAL REGRESSION EVIDENCE ONLY. Passing here is not a Ghent Workgroup
conformance certification, and no result from this file may be worded as one.

What this gate can and cannot decide is set out in `tests/ghent-expected.tsv`:
the suite's verdict is visual, so pytest drives the machine-decidable half —
the app's own surfaces reading each patch (ink inventory, overprint state,
colour family, optional content, image construct, output intent) and the real
separation pipeline rasterizing the assembled pages into plates. The visual
half belongs to a human with the reference page.

Every run records the settings it ran under (`ghent-corpus/run-settings.json`).
The suite's own documentation states that application and device settings
affect results, so a result without its settings is not evidence.
