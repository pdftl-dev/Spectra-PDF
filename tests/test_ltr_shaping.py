"""Shaping on the LEFT-TO-RIGHT path.

The joining scripts have a shaper because they have no correct
per-character rendering at all. Latin does — right up until a combining mark
or a ligature is involved, at which point the per-character emission draws a
diacritic as a spacing glyph beside its letter, and never forms a ligature the
face is holding. These pin the two capabilities and, just as importantly, the
line between them and the text that must keep taking the old path unchanged.
