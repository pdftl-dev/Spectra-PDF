"""The PDF Association's Techniques for Accessible PDF, as a gate.

Expected results this repo did not author. Each technique is one minimal
document with an upstream verdict: a `Pass` file conforms to PDF/UA-1, a `Fail`
file violates exactly what its name states. Two claims are asserted.

**No PASS file may fail any check.** A false failure on a document the standard's
own publisher calls conforming is the one result an accessibility report cannot
survive, so this is asserted across the whole inventory rather than only the
checks a technique is about. `needs_review` is not a failure — it is this
checker saying it did not decide.

**A covered FAIL file must be reported by the check that owns its defect.**
`COVERAGE.json` names which check, and at which status. A technique testing
something no check answers is recorded there as `uncovered` with its Matterhorn
checkpoints — a recorded gap, never a silent drop.

**A technique whose defect is not decidable is covered as a REVIEW, and says
why.** Some of what these files test is a judgement about the content — whether
a graphic stands in for text, whether a run of paragraphs is a list, where a
sidebar belongs in the reading order. A checker that guessed `fail` on those
would be trading false failures for a coverage number, so the row records
`covered_as_review` with the check that carries the evidence and a written
reason. The reason is the point: a review row nobody can read the argument for
is a silent drop wearing a different word.

The corpus is pinned: every file's SHA-256 is in `MANIFEST.json`, and a file
that is present but unlisted, or listed but absent, fails here rather than
changing what the gate means.
