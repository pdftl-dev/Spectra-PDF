"""The gate over the engine refusal table.

`src/renderer/locales/engine-messages.tsv` is a CHECKED-IN, reviewed table:
every user-facing refusal the engine raises, mapped to the stable catalog key
that renders it in the UI language. The renderer matches an incoming engine
message against it and localizes what it recognizes; anything else passes
through verbatim.

That only stays true if the table tracks the engine. These tests re-run the
sweep and fail the moment a refusal is added, reworded, moved or removed
without the table being regenerated — the same shape as the Tesseract notice
inventory's build-time refusal, and for the same reason: an inventory nobody
re-checks is an inventory that quietly stops being true.

    Regenerate:  .venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/gen-engine-messages.py
    then review the diff and commit it.
