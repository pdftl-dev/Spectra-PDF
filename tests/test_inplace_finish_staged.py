"""Writing back over the input, for the ops that staged imperatively.

`test_inplace_staged_write` pins the same three properties for the ops that
already wrote through `staged_write`. These are the ops that instead held the
staged path in a local, wrote it, and landed it with a separate
`finish_staged` call — a shape with two failure modes the context manager does
not have:

  * `finish_staged` swapped with `shutil.move`, which on Windows degrades to a
    COPY when the destination exists. For an output that names its own input
    that copy runs INTO the document, so a death part-way through leaves the
    user's file truncated. The hard-link alias below is what reads the
    difference: after a directory-entry swap the second name still holds the
    bytes it held, after a copy it holds whatever the copy wrote.
  * Nothing owned the span between the staging and the swap, so a producer
    that died left the temp file sitting beside the document.

The ops are grouped by the shape their staging takes rather than covered one
by one:

  * `save` — one `save_pdf` into the staged path, the swap inside the block
    that holds the Pdf open. The close is load-bearing: `os.replace` onto a
    destination pikepdf still holds is `PermissionError` on Windows.
  * `nested` — the producer is another engine op, not a save.
  * `producer` — Ghostscript writes the staged path over seconds, and the
    staging is conditional: one variable is either the staged file or the
    output itself.
