"""The capability-absent axis: every Ghostscript door, with none configured.

This is not the same suite as `test_gs_capability.py`, which proves the
AUTHORITY answers correctly and spot-checks representative doors. This one is
a ROSTER: the doors are derived mechanically from the same sweep the guards
use (`gs_axis.gs_door_modules`), so the set under test is the set that
exists, and a new Ghostscript consumer cannot ship without an absent-state
answer — adding one makes `test_the_roster_covers_every_gs_door` fail with
the module's name in the diff.

Four things are asserted at every door, because three of the four failure
modes are silent:

* it REFUSES, by the named refusal (`GsUnavailable`) carrying its reason;
* it does not CRASH — nothing else escapes, and in particular no
  `FileNotFoundError` from a spawn that was attempted anyway;
* it does not SILENTLY SUCCEED — a door that returns a report is a door that
  produced something without an interpreter, which for these doors means it
  produced something wrong;
* it leaves NO PARTIAL OUTPUT. A refusal that has already written half a
  file hands the user a document that opens and is incomplete, which is the
  worst of the four: it looks like the operation worked.

The whole roster runs on every machine. The force is applied to the
authority's discovery and probe, so a developer box with a working
Ghostscript exercises the same code path as one without.
