"""The point inspector: which object, which colour space, how much ink.

Every wrong answer this feature can give is plausible, so nothing here is
eyeballed: the fixture places five objects at known coordinates in five
colour spaces and each point is asserted against that geometry. The row that
pins the mechanism is the one inside the diagonal stroke's bounding box and
far from the line — a box-only hit test passes every other row of the table
and names the stroke there, where the page paints nothing.

Ghostscript-backed cases carry the `gs_path` skip guard, which tests for the
EXECUTABLE rather than its directory. The colour-space table needs no device
at all and is asserted against the walk directly.
