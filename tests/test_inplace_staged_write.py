"""Writing back over the input, for every op that accepts `output == file`.

The panel hands the open document's path twice and the fixup chain feeds each
door the file the door before it wrote, so in place is the shape the real
callers use — not an edge case. Three properties are pinned for each op, as one
family rather than a pile of coincidences:

  * in place lands what a distinct output lands, byte for byte;
  * a write that dies leaves the input whole and nothing staged beside it;
  * one physical file under two names is recognised as one file.

`save_pdf` derives the trailer `/ID` from the written bytes, so one input has
exactly one output — which makes "in place did the same thing" a byte
comparison rather than an assertion. An op whose own output varies run to run
says so on its case (`deterministic=False`) and is compared by what it drew
instead; nothing is quietly excluded.

class Case:
    """One op that accepts `output == file`.

    `module` is the namespace whose `save_pdf` the death test replaces, so it
    has to be the module that performs the write rather than the one that
    defines it. `leaves` names what the BUILD legitimately puts beside the
    document — an op's own input file — so that "nothing staged" stays a claim
    about staging.

    `deterministic` is False for an op whose own output varies run to run, so
    the two runs are compared by `_drawn` instead of by bytes; the reason is
    named on each such case.

    `doors` names the registered engine doors this case drives, which is what
    the coverage guard counts. It is a tuple because one case can only claim
    the doors it actually calls: a case that reaches its writer some other way
    claims none, and the door it does not drive stays uncovered.

    `run_gs` replaces `run` for a case whose op needs the bundled Ghostscript;
    it takes the interpreter's path as a third argument.

    `varies` names result fields that are a function of the RUN rather than of
    the input — a byte count an external producer's own timestamp moves. Every
    other field of the result is still compared.

    `dies` names the producer the death test replaces and `staged_of` reads the
    path that producer was told to write. Both default to a `save_pdf` whose
    second argument is that path — the shape every pikepdf-backed op has. An op
    whose producer is Ghostscript names `budget.gs` instead, and reads the
    staged path out of the command line it was handed.

    `compare` is how the two runs are read when the op is not deterministic;
    `_drawn` by default. An op whose output cannot be REOPENED as an ordinary
    PDF — a document locked to a certificate — names a reader that can, so
    "in place did the same thing" stays a comparison of the document rather
    than of the container.

# The failure mode is concrete. A door in one module can write through a
# private `_save` defined in another: `set_table_headers` through
# `struct_tree`, `make_portfolio` and `update_portfolio_member` through
# `attachments`. A change to that helper's signature is checked against the
# defining module's own suite, which passes, and the cross-module caller
# raises `TypeError` on every call — reachable only through a door nothing
# exercises.
#
# So the roster below is checked against the engine's own registrations rather
# than against itself: every door that accepts writing over its own input is
# cased here, cased in the `finish_staged` family, or named in one of the two
# tables — never absent.
