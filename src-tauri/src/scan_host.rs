//! The scanner HOST: every WIA call runs in a separate process.
//!
//! A WIA apartment cannot be torn down with a bound. `CoUninitialize` on an
//! apartment that reached a scanner driver runs COM's DLL-unload pass, which
//! calls `FreeLibrary` on `sti.dll` under the process-wide loader lock; when
//! that unload blocks on a lock an in-process driver thread still holds, the
//! loader lock is held with it, and every other thread that tries to exit
//! stops inside `LdrShutdownThread` and never returns. At that point the
//! process cannot exit, cannot join its threads, and cannot be recovered from
//! inside itself: the stalled thread is unpreemptable, abandoning it does not
//! release the loader lock, and omitting `CoUninitialize` leaks an apartment
//! on every scan instead.
//!
//! The only bound that holds over a loader-lock stall is the one enforced from
//! outside the process. So the WIA code runs in a child process, every request
//! carries a deadline, and a breach terminates the child — `TerminateProcess`
//! needs no loader lock, so it succeeds on exactly the state nothing else can
//! unwedge. The next request spawns a new child.
//!
//! What this buys, per consequence:
//!
//! * The parent never loads `sti.dll` and never initialises a WIA apartment,
//!   so no scanner driver can reach its loader or its thread-exit path.
//! * A stalled driver costs one refusal and one child process, not the app.
//! * Hardware behaviour is unchanged: the child runs the same WIA code, on
//!   the same real device, and reports the same devices, capabilities, pages
//!   and refusals.
//!
//! A request is bounded in two phases because the stall lands between them.
//! The child reports `body` the moment the WIA work returns, before the
//! apartment is torn down; the driver call gets [`CALL_DEADLINE`] and the
//! teardown that follows gets [`TEARDOWN_DEADLINE`]. An acquisition's driver
//! phase is bounded by the device's own callback liveness rather than by a
//! wall clock: each progress event refreshes its deadline, because a long
//! feeder run is not a stall and a run producing nothing is.
//!
//! The device picker is the one request with no driver-phase deadline: it is
//! open until a person closes it. Its teardown is bounded like every other.
