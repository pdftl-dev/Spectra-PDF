//! The guided scanner checklist runner behind `spectrapdf scan-test`.
//!
//! Most rows of the scanner checklist cannot be posed on a
//! flatbed-only device. This module is what a tester with the missing
//! hardware runs: the rows that can be judged from the staged pages are
//! judged here, the rows that need a physical act (load the feeder, pull the
//! power, induce a jam) prompt for it and wait, and every row records the same
//! evidence a hand-run checklist would — pixel geometry, resolution read back
//! from the image's own header, bit depth, header integrity and a grayscale
//! histogram verdict separating real content from a blank or uniform page.
//!
//! A file that exists is not evidence. Nothing in the report carries image
//! content: the histogram travels as five aggregate numbers and a verdict,
//! never as pixels, and a staged page leaves the machine only when the tester
//! passes `--attach-scans`.
//!
//! The COM work stays in `scanner.rs`; this module only drives it, so the
//! apartment rule cannot be broken from here.
