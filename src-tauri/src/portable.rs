//! Which container this binary is running in, and the four answers that
//! follow from it.
//!
//! Two containers ship the SAME payload tree: the NSIS installer lays it down
//! under `$INSTDIR`, and `spectrapdf-<version>-portable.zip` carries the
//! identical bytes to wherever the user extracts them. Everything below is the
//! set of decisions that differ between the two.
//!
//! **The container is decided structurally, never by inspecting the path.** The
//! installer writes `install-record.json` beside the executable in its
//! post-install hook; the zip has no such file and cannot acquire one. A path
//! heuristic ("is this under Program Files?") would misread a zip extracted to
//! `C:\Program Files\` and an installer redirected by `/D=` alike, in opposite
//! directions.
//!
//! The same record carries the installer's Adobe colour-profile EULA
//! acceptance, which the installer has already obtained by the time it runs the
//! hook: interactively through the wizard's licence page (the bundler's
//! `licenseFile` is that exact text), and unattended through `/acceptEULA`,
//! which `nsis-hooks.nsh` refuses to install without. So an installed run
//! carries its acceptance and never asks again; a portable run has no record
//! until the first-run dialog writes one.
