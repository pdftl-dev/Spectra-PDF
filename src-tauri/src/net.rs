//! The app's ONE outbound HTTP client.
//!
//! Every outbound request the product makes on a user's behalf comes through
//! here: the form-submission transmit and the open-from-web-address door share
//! this module rather than each growing a client. The renderer never fetches;
//! it hands a validated request across and receives a status, a content type
//! and a path to bytes on disk.
//!
//! The properties this module exists to hold, each of them structural:
//!
//!   * **No ambient authority.** No cookie store (the `cookies` feature is not
//!     enabled, so there is no jar to attach), no credential store, no
//!     proxy-authentication prompt, no `Authorization` header, no persisted
//!     session between requests. A request carries what its caller put in it
//!     and nothing the machine happens to remember.
//!   * **A plain user agent.** `SpectraPDF/<version>` — the product and the
//!     version, no platform inventory.
//!   * **Redirects are followed SAME-ORIGIN ONLY**, and origin includes the
//!     scheme: a redirect that changes scheme or host aborts and names both
//!     hosts, because the address the user consented to is the address that
//!     was shown. Following redirects is done here rather than by the
//!     transport so the refusal can say what it refused.
//!   * **Destinations are classified before connecting.** Each hop's host is
//!     resolved and every resolved address is classified (loopback, RFC1918,
//!     link-local incl. cloud metadata, ULA, unspecified); the transport is
//!     pinned to the validated addresses. A DOCUMENT-chosen submit refuses a
//!     private target by name; a USER-typed open allows a private FIRST hop
//!     (the dialog warns) but a redirect that starts public and lands private
//!     is refused on either path — that hop was never shown.
//!   * **A response is bytes on disk**, capped, never interpreted here. What
//!     reads them is whatever ordinary parser the caller routes them to.
//!
//! Nothing received here is executed, and nothing here opens a shell.
