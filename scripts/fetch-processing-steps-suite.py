"""MAINTENANCE TOOL, not a build step. Fetches the GWG Processing Steps Test
Suite v1.0 once, at a pinned archive digest, into the gitignored
`processing-steps-corpus/`.

WHAT THIS IS NOT

Passing the internal gate this corpus feeds is REGRESSION EVIDENCE ONLY. It is
never a conformance certification, and it is not an ISO 19593-1 conformance
claim: the Ghent Workgroup runs a certification programme with its own process
and this repository is not in it, and the standard itself is not held here at
all. No output of this script, and no test that consumes it, may be described
as certified or as conforming.

WHY THE CORPUS IS NEVER COMMITTED

Same posture as `ghent-corpus/`, `pdfa-corpus/` and `pdfa/`: the suite is
published by the Ghent Workgroup for testing workflow setup, this repository is
public and the product is commercial, and a commit here would be a
redistribution under terms nobody has obtained. The archive is fetched onto a
developer's disk and stays there. Moving that line needs written permission
from the Ghent Workgroup, not a re-reading of a download page.

WHAT IS FETCHED

  suite — 39 test patches, each exercising one detail of the specification,
          plus the suite's own documentation stating each patch's expected
          verdict. The patch file names carry the verdict: a name ending `G`
          must be accepted, `E` must be rejected, `W` is compliant but
          notable.

Pinned by SHA-256 of the archive AND by a per-file manifest of the extracted
tree, so a future GWG revision is a deliberate re-pin rather than silent
drift. A pin moves only by editing this file.
