# Vendors the official upstream jbig2enc binary into resources/jbig2enc/.
#
# The MRC pass writes its 1-bit text stencil as /JBIG2Decode, and
# nothing in the shipped stack can encode JBIG2: qpdf decodes only, Ghostscript
# has no JBIG2 encoder, Pillow has none, and the OCR runtime's libjbig-0.dll is
# JBIG*1* (T.85, for TIFF) which PDF does not accept. A pure-Python encoder is
# not an option either -- the MQ arithmetic coder is inherently sequential over
# ~8.4 million pixel contexts per page, which is minutes per page for a step
# that must be milliseconds.
#
# So the encoder is native, and it is VENDORED and invoked as a subprocess --
# byte-for-byte the Ghostscript pattern. jbig2enc 0.32 publishes official
# prebuilt Windows x64 MSVC release assets, so no compiler enters the packaging
# chain. Apache-2.0; the statically-linked components are enumerated below.
#
# Run before packaging: powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\bundle-jbig2enc.ps1
