# Verifies a DRAFT release against the build that produced it, from the bytes
# GitHub actually holds. Every asset is downloaded by its asset id into a
# scratch directory and hashed; the downloaded hash must equal the local
# build's, the downloaded SHA256SUMS.txt must name every checksummed asset with
# the hash of the downloaded bytes, and the downloaded installer signature must
# be the one latest.json carries. A size match proves nothing here: a
# same-length upload with different bytes is exactly the case that hashing
# exists to catch.
#
# Every identity comparison in this file is ORDINAL. PowerShell's default
# operators (-eq/-ne/-replace/-match), hashtables, and PSObject property
# lookups are case-insensitive, while every consumer of these identities is
# not: the updater resolves platform keys and requests `latest.json` by exact
# name, an asset name is exact on GitHub, a base64 signature differing in one
# letter's case is a different signature, and `sha256sum -c` matches filenames
# exactly. A case-only difference therefore has to fail here, so lookups go
# through ordinal dictionaries, sets through ordinal HashSets, and scalars
# through -ceq/-cne or [string]::Equals(..., Ordinal).
#
# Downloads go through curl.exe, never a PowerShell redirection: a redirected
# native command's stdout is decoded and re-encoded as text, which corrupts
# binary assets. The Authorization header is dropped on the cross-host redirect
# to the asset store (curl's default), which that store requires.
#
# The manifest's last check is the updater plugin's own deserializer: the
# downloaded latest.json is parsed by `cargo test --test verifier_<hex>_updater_manifest`
# in -CargoPackage with the RemoteRelease type the installed copies read it with
# (its `time` RFC 3339 parse of `pub_date`, its unknown-field policy), then
# compared against the tag version, the release body, and the installer. A
# manifest this script re-implemented the shape of could pass here and still
# refuse to parse in every installed copy, which is the launch update check
# failing everywhere at once. -CargoPackage defaults to the checkout's own
# `src-tauri`; the redo passes a TAG's package so the parse runs against the
# updater version THAT package pins.
#
# The verifier LOGIC never comes from -CargoPackage. The Rust source beside
# this script (src-tauri/tests/updater_manifest.rs at this script's revision)
# is copied on every run to a target name under the prefix reserved to this
# script -- src-tauri/tests/verifier_<16 random hex>_updater_manifest.rs. No
# product revision commits a file under `tests/verifier_`
# (tests/test_ci_capability_setup.py refuses the prefix in the index,
# .gitignore refuses it in the working tree). Selecting logic by whether the
# package already holds a conventionally named test would let a tag's own
# stale or accepting copy stand in for the current verifier while reporting
# the current verdict.
#
# A hashed file is not yet an executed target: cargo resolves `--test <name>`
# through the verified package's Cargo.toml, so a fixed reserved name could be
# claimed there by an explicit `[[test]] name = "<reserved>" path = "..."`
# (explicit targets outrank the inferred tests/<name>.rs of the same name) and
# `autotests = false` can suppress inference entirely. The invariant enforced
# instead: the executed test target IS the staged file, proven by cargo's own
# resolution. The target name is fresh per run, so no manifest can name it in
# advance; after staging, `cargo metadata --no-deps` for the package must list
# EXACTLY one `test` target of that name whose src_path, canonicalized (real
# on-disk case, compared ordinally), is the staged file; the package manifest
# must not set `autotests = false` and no `[[test]]` in it may name or path
# anything under the reserved prefix; and the `Running <path>` line cargo
# prints for the executed binary must resolve to the staged file. The staged
# bytes are hashed against the source after the copy and removed after the
# run; the package's own updater_manifest.rs is never read.
#
# An executed target is not yet an executed test: the harness takes a test
# name as a substring filter and a run that matches nothing passes with
# `running 0 tests`. The staged target is therefore listed first (exactly
# one test of the verifier's name, none sharing its prefix), then run with
# `--exact` on one thread, and the harness output must carry `running 1
# test`, `test <name> ... ok`, and a tally of 1 passed / 0 failed / 0
# ignored. cargo is never invoked through a pipeline: the exit code and
# both streams come from the child process and are retained beside the
# downloads.
#
# Residual, by design: the verification runs INSIDE the package under test --
# its pinned updater plugin, its build.rs, its Cargo.lock. The verifier CODE is
# this revision's; the CRATE the code exercises is the tag's, because the
# question being answered is whether the manifest parses with the updater
# version THAT tag's binaries carry.
#
# GitHub RENAMES an uploaded asset (scripts/github-asset-name.ps1): characters
# outside [A-Za-z0-9._-] become '.', so the local `Spectra PDF_<v>_x64-setup.exe`
# is served as `Spectra.PDF_<v>_x64-setup.exe`. Every name comparison here is
# therefore between GitHub's names: the local build's names are mapped through
# Get-GitHubAssetName once and looked up by the mapped name, and the mapping is
# what carries a downloaded file back to the local file it must hash-equal. A
# draft carrying the un-renamed local name is refused -- GitHub cannot produce
# one, so it is not this build's upload. The SHA256SUMS.txt name column and the
# manifest's asset url go through the same mapping, because the public verifies
# the downloaded file under the name GitHub gave it.
#
# -Offline <dir> skips the API and reads <dir>/release.json, <dir>/assets.json
# and the "downloaded" asset files from <dir>; the comparison is otherwise the
# same, which is what tests/test_ci_capability_setup.py drives. -Repo is still
# required: the manifest urls are compared against the exact asset url built
# from it.
