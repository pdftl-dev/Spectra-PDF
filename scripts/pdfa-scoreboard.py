"""MAINTENANCE TOOL, not a build step. Runs this product's own readers over
the fetched conformance corpora and writes
`pdfa-corpus/scoreboard.json` (gitignored, like everything else under there).

THIS IS A SCOREBOARD, NOT A TARGET

Passing every file in a conformance suite means agreeing with the judgement of
whoever authored the files, which is not the same as implementing the clause —
BFO marks two of its own cases *contentious*, and the veraPDF corpus ships an
`Undefined/` tree of cases its authors decline to call. So this tool records
what we do against each stated verdict and leaves the interpreting to a person.
A file we agree with that no stated rule explains is FLAGGED, not counted as a
win.

WHAT IT MEASURES, AND WHY THAT IS THE HONEST SET TODAY

There is no PDF/A validator in this tree, and this tool exists to size that
absence rather than to hide it. The shipped preflight
profiles are press and PDF/X profiles; none of them is PDF/A. What the product
genuinely does with an arbitrary file is therefore what gets measured:

  opens      `validate_pdf` — the door every whole-file op goes through. A
             conformance corpus is deliberately malformed, so this is the one
             pass that can find a defect in OUR code rather than a gap in our
             coverage: an unhandled exception here is a crash on a real file.
  declared   `standards_report.declared_pdfa` — what the file asserts about
             itself. `convert_pdfa` already refuses when this disagrees with
             what was asked for, so it is a shipped decision point.
  checks     the accessibility checks, for the PDF/UA parts, and the preflight
             checks, for the rest. Both report per check, so a fired check can
             be attributed to a clause.

A run records raw outcomes per file. Attributing a check to a clause is a
separate judgement and is NOT made here: the judgement lives in
`engine/clause_map.py`, next to the checks it is about, and this tool only
measures it. Inventing the mapping inside the measurement would grade our own
work with our own answer key.

WHAT THE CLAUSE SECTIONS REPORT

  coverage    per part: how many of the part's clauses ANY shipped check
              decides. The denominator is the corpus' clause count for that
              part, which is what the suite covers rather than what the
              standard contains, so the figure is a floor on the gap and never
              a ceiling on it. The uncited checks are listed alongside — a
              coverage figure that hides its own gaps is the thing the map
              exists to stop.
  scoring     per cited clause: the cited checks are run over that clause's
              corpus files and compared to the verdict each file's name
              declares. Two outcomes are findings rather than scores.

              FLAGGED ON PASS — a cited check fails a file the suite passes.
              It is a CANDIDATE false alarm and never called one here: a
              suite's pass verdict is per TEST, so it says the file satisfies
              the rule that test targets, not that the file satisfies every
              requirement of the clause the test is filed under. Deciding
              which of the two a case is takes a person, and the cases
              adjudicated so far are recorded in `engine/clause_map.py`
              rather than in a counter.

              UNEVIDENCED CITATION — no fire on any of the clause's failing
              files, so the corpus supports the citation with nothing.
