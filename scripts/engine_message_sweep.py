"""The engine refusal inventory.

Engine messages stay ENGLISH AT THE ENGINE: diagnostics, the CLI and the
logs are English by contract, and the fingerprint text is byte-stable. What
localizes is the RENDERER's rendering of them, and it does that by matching
the message it received against a checked-in table of the engine's own
refusals.

This module is the sweep that keeps that table honest. It walks every
`src/engine/*.py` with `ast` and enumerates two kinds of refusal:

  * each `raise` of a PUBLIC exception type carrying a literal message — the
    refusals that leave a registered JSON-RPC method and reach the renderer
    through `ipc.py`'s `str(exc)`.
  * each LISTING-level refusal reason carrying a literal message: an
    assignment to a `reason`/`blocking_reason` target, and the first argument
    of a `_refuse*` capability factory. These never raise; they ride a
    listing result's `reason` field and the renderer prints them, so an
    unlisted one is a bare English string in a localized UI exactly as a
    missing raise row would be.

Two consumers share it:

  * `scripts/gen-engine-messages.py` — the MAINTENANCE tool. Run it when the
    engine's messages change; it rewrites the table, PRESERVING the key of
    every message that already had one, and the diff is reviewed and
    committed. (The `fetch-tesseract-licenses.ps1` precedent: generated once,
    reviewed as a git diff, checked in, regenerated only when the source
    moves — never re-derived at build time.)
  * `tests/test_engine_messages.py` — the GATE. It re-runs the sweep and
    fails when the engine's live inventory diverges from the checked-in
    table, so a new or reworded refusal cannot silently become an
    unlocalized string in the UI.

Classification, and its limits (stated rather than implied):

  * PUBLIC exception types only. The engine's internal sentinels
    (`SvgUnsupported`, `_TransplantRefusal`, `_Unserializable`,
    `_AlreadyHandled`) are control flow their own callers catch — a
    transplant refusal is a RESULT that triggers the ordinary-rewrite
    fallback, never a message the user sees — so they are not refusals and
    are excluded by construction.
  * A raise lexically inside a `try` whose handlers catch its type is
    INTERNAL: it never leaves the function, so it never reaches the bridge.
  * A raise whose message is not a literal (a bare variable, a formatted
    exception passed through) is DYNAMIC: there is no text to match on, so
    it is out of the table by construction and passes through verbatim.
  * The heuristic is deliberately over-inclusive across FUNCTION boundaries:
    a helper's ValueError caught by its caller still lands in the table. An
    extra row costs one translated string; a missing row costs a bare
    English message in a localized UI, so the asymmetry is taken on purpose.
