# Stages the bundled ICC colour profiles into resources/icc/.
#
# SOURCE: the committed copies under vendor/icc/. Nothing is fetched and no
# network is touched. The profiles were extracted once from a licensed bundler
# package (AdobeICCProfilesCS4Win_bundler.zip, sha256
# 396ea37eaa3f048df261f4c0e4595b91e52cf64f823e02d1d601e25ae8eee12f) and
# committed, so a build machine that has never seen that package -- CI, a fresh
# clone -- provisions the exact same bytes. The per-profile sha256 column in
# scripts/icc-profiles.tsv is the integrity record and is verified on the way
# out of vendor/icc and again on disk.
#
# Two grants of the Color Profile Bundling Agreement dated 10/20/2008 are in
# play, and they carry the same Section 3 conditions: the copies committed in
# this repository travel under the standalone-distribution grant (section
# 2(a)), and the copies this script writes into the product travel under the
# bundled-with-an-application grant (section 2(d)). Those shared conditions are
# what this script enforces:
#   - The profiles ship UNMODIFIED. Every file is sha256-verified twice; a
#     mismatch refuses.
#   - Each profile carries its own copyright notice in its ICC `cprt` tag, and
#     that tag travels because the bytes are unmodified. The manifest repeats
#     the notice so a row cannot be added for a profile nobody read.
#   - End users receive the profiles under the agreement's Exhibit B end-user
#     licence, which ships beside them as Adobe-Color-Profile-License.txt,
#     including the statement that the profiles are available from us or from
#     the upstream and how to obtain them. The same text sits beside the
#     committed copies in vendor/icc.
#   - Every profile is referenced by its ICC profile description string. The
#     manifest's `description` column is that string; nothing keys off a file
#     name.
#
# Layout written:
#   resources/icc/<upstream base name>.icc
#   resources/icc/Adobe-Color-Profile-License.txt
#
# Run before packaging:
#   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\bundle-icc.ps1
#
# -WriteManifest re-reads every file in vendor/icc and writes the sha256 column
# back into the manifest instead of verifying it. That is the deliberate
# pin-bump path: replace the committed bytes, run it once, review the diff,
# commit. Never wired into a build -- git is the integrity record.
