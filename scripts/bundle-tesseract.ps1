# Vendors native Tesseract OCR into resources/tesseract/.
#
# Upstream ships no Windows binary and points Windows users at
# the UB Mannheim build, so that is the source: downloaded, verified against a
# pinned SHA-256, and extracted from the NSIS installer with 7-Zip WITHOUT
# running it -- the same technique bundle-jbig2enc.ps1 uses.
#
# Tesseract is Apache-2.0 and Leptonica (its imaging dependency) is BSD-2-Clause.
# tesseract.exe is invoked as a separate process, unmodified upstream (see
# THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md).
#
# ONE binary of that installer is not shipped as it came: its libtiff-6.dll
# statically imports libjbig-0.dll (JBIG-KIT, GPL-2.0-or-later), which the
# license-class gate refuses as object code. The replacement is built by
# scripts/build-libtiff-nojbig.ps1 -- the same libtiff version from the same
# recipe with JBIG disabled -- and is installed over the installer's copy here,
# after which libjbig-0.dll is dropped. Nothing in the product can reach JBIG:
# both Tesseract spawn sites receive a PNG this program rendered.
#
# The LANGUAGE MODELS are NOT staged here -- scripts/sync-ocr-assets.mjs owns
# them, because the offered-language list is parsed out of the app's own
# languages.ts and must stay a single source of truth.
#
# Run before packaging: powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\bundle-tesseract.ps1
