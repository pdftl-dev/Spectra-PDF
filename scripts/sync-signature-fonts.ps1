# Vendors the SCRIPT faces the personal-signature "type" door draws with,
# into resources/fonts beside the Edit-tool fallback family - the same repo
# hygiene class as resources/python and resources/tesseract: assembled by
# script, gitignored, SHIPPED in the product bundle (tauri.conf.json maps
# ../resources/fonts -> fonts).
#
# Three faces, all SIL OFL 1.1, chosen for three DIFFERENT hands rather than
# three shades of one:
#   Great Vibes  -> formal calligraphic copperplate
#   Sacramento   -> casual monoline script
#   Parisienne   -> informal flowing hand
#
# They are a signature's face, never a text-layout fallback: nothing in the
# font-resolution ladder reaches them, and only an asset that names one draws
# with it. A typed signature embeds the named face's SUBSET through pdf-lib,
# so a machine that never had the face still renders the signature.
#
# NO SYSTEM-FONT DEPENDENCE is the point: a clean runner has no handwriting
# face installed, and a typed signature that silently fell back to Helvetica
# would be a wrong result rather than a missing one.
#
# Pinned twice, like sync-edit-fonts.ps1: the source is an IMMUTABLE commit of
# google/fonts, and each extracted file is individually sha256-verified. A
# silent upstream change fails loudly here instead of shipping unnoticed. To
# bump: move $Commit and every hash together, re-run, eyeball, commit.
#
# The SIL OFL 1.1 requires the license text to ACCOMPANY distributed font
# copies, so each family's OFL.txt is vendored beside its face and ships
# through the same resources mapping. THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md section Fonts
# carries the notice rows.
#
# ASCII ONLY in this file: Windows PowerShell 5.1 reads BOM-less UTF-8 as
# ANSI, and a multi-byte dash inside a QUOTED string mangles into a
# parser-breaking byte.
