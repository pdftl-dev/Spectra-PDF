"""MAINTENANCE TOOL, not a build step. Fetches the Ghent PDF Output Suite 5.0
once, at pinned archive digests, into the gitignored `ghent-corpus/`.

WHAT THIS IS NOT

Passing the internal gate this corpus feeds is REGRESSION EVIDENCE ONLY. It is
never a conformance certification: the Ghent Workgroup runs a certification
programme with its own process, aimed at print service providers, and this
repository is not in it. No output of this script, and no test that consumes
it, may be described as certified.

WHY THE CORPUS IS NEVER COMMITTED

The download pages publish no terms, but the archives carry a legal notice of
their own: permission to use the suite for testing workflow setup, the notice
required in any copy of the whole or a substantial portion, no use outside that
purpose without written permission, and no sale or commercial use without
written permission. This repository is public and the product is commercial, so
a commit here would be a redistribution under terms nobody has obtained. The
archives are fetched onto a developer's disk and stay there — the same posture
as `pdfa-corpus/` and `pdfa/`. Moving that line needs written permission from
the Ghent Workgroup, not a re-reading of the notice.

WHAT IS FETCHED

  Test pages  — six assembled PDF/X-4 pages carrying 48 patches, plus the
                suite's own documentation stating each patch's expected result.
  Patches     — the same patches as individual files, for localizing a failure
                to one construct instead of one page.

Both are pinned by SHA-256 of the archive AND by a per-file manifest of the
extracted tree, so a future GWG revision is a deliberate re-pin rather than
silent drift. A pin moves only by editing this file.
