"""MAINTENANCE TOOL, not a build step. Fetches the public PDF/A conformance
suites once, at pinned commits, into the gitignored `pdfa-corpus/`.

WHY THE CORPUS IS NEVER COMMITTED AND NEVER SHIPPED

Neither upstream declares a licence — the GitHub licence field is null for
both, and neither tree carries a LICENSE file. Redistribution terms we cannot
read are terms we cannot satisfy, so the files are fetched onto a developer's
disk and stay there. This repository is public; a commit here republishes them.
The same rule already governs `pdfa/`, and it is the reason this is a fetch
script rather than a vendored directory.

WHAT THE CORPUS IS FOR, AND WHAT IT IS NOT FOR

It is a SCOREBOARD, not a target. Passing every file would mean agreeing with
the judgement of whoever authored the files, which is not the same as
implementing the clause — BFO's own notes mark two cases *contentious*, where
implementations legitimately disagree. So the scoreboard records what this
product does against each stated rule, and a file we pass that no stated rule
explains is flagged rather than counted.

A claim sourced this way is worded "corroborated by two independent conformance
suites at clause X". It is never worded "the standard requires", because the
standard is ISO 19005 and this repository does not hold it. Where the
normative text IS on disk, it outranks every file here.

WHAT IS FETCHED

  bfocom/pdfa-testsuite   — one flat directory plus `description.txt`, which
                            states the RULE per file ("More than 28 q/Q nests",
                            "Embedded file is not PDF/A") and marks the
                            relaxations between PDF/A-1 and PDF/A-2.
  veraPDF/veraPDF-corpus  — organised as the standard's own table of contents
                            (`PDF_A-1b/6.1 File structure/6.1.2 File header/…`),
                            and it bundles the Isartor suite under
                            `Isartor test files/`.

Both are pinned by commit SHA below. A pin moves only by editing this file, so
what the scoreboard measured is always recoverable.
