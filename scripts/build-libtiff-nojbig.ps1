# Builds the JBIG-free libtiff-6.dll that bundle-tesseract.ps1 installs over the
# one shipped by the Tesseract installer.
#
# The vendored Tesseract build's libtiff-6.dll carries a static (non-delayed) PE
# import of libjbig-0.dll, so the tree cannot ship without that DLL: the process
# never starts. libjbig is JBIG-KIT, GPL-2.0-or-later, and GPL object code is
# never shipped. Nothing in the product can reach JBIG --
# both Tesseract spawn sites are handed a PNG this program rendered -- so the
# compression is rebuilt out rather than the dependency reasoned around.
#
# This is a MAINTENANCE tool, like fetch-tesseract-licenses.ps1: it runs when the
# Tesseract pin moves, and its output is reviewed and committed. The build itself
# is the MSYS2 mingw-w64 libtiff recipe at the pinned version with --enable-jbig
# turned into --disable-jbig and nothing else changed, so the DLL that results is
# the shipped one minus one codec: same version, same soname, same CRT (msvcrt),
# same remaining imports.
#
# Requires an MSYS2 installation with the MINGW64 environment. Pass -Msys2Root or
# set MSYS2_ROOT; nothing is installed outside it.
