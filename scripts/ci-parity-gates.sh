# ci-parity-gates.sh — run LOCALLY before every push, so CI's gates fail on
# this machine (seconds) instead of on the runner (an hour, tokens, a red tag).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: an audit of 22 CI/Release failures (2026-08-25) found ~86%
# were catchable locally — the top buckets were the two dependency audits, the
# test-axis provisioning gate, and the tag/version-consistency check, none of
# which the old local battery ran. Six hours of runner time in two days went to
# failures a five-second local check would have caught.
#
# This is NOT the full battery (tsc/lint/vitest/pytest — run those too). This
# is the set of CI gates the battery historically OMITTED. Run BOTH.
#
# The full engine suite runs here only as the workflow-contract gate's single
# file. `--durations=25` therefore lives on the runners' full-suite invocations
# (.github/workflows/ci.yml "Run engine tests (full suite)" and release.yml
# "Engine tests (full suite)"), which is where a stall has no other name.
#
# Exit non-zero on any gate failure. Each gate logs to its own *.local.log.

# --- Release gate: the signing script must no-op outside CI. A dev build that

#     A workflow edit that breaks the contract otherwise surfaces on the runner
#     (CI #144: the Ghostscript step moved into a script and the contract test's
#     substring lookup raised). Also carries the publish-order contract: both
#     release publishers upload to a draft, gate the uploaded assets, and
#     undraft as the LAST step. Cheap enough to run on every push. ---
#     This run cannot detect a tagless checkout: a developer clone carries the
#     released tags by construction, so the runner's shallow, tagless checkout
#     is guarded by the workflow contract inside this file's test instead
