// sheet cannot show three different markers. Its own module because four
// surfaces need it (the Takeoff panel, the secondary toolbar's group picker,
// the symbol palette, and the comment list) and none of them should have to
// import another surface to get it.
//
// The resolution is wide and the API is not: an id is looked up in
// the whole symbol REGISTRY (built-in markers, the built-in AEC set, and every
// imported set), and an explicit `parts` wins over any lookup — that is how an
// annotation carrying its own geometry draws correctly on a machine that never
// imported the set it came from.
