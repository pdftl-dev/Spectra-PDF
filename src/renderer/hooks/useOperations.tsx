/** An undoable workspace operation: finish and validate private output, then
 * publish working bytes, buffer and the original undo snapshot together.
 * This is App's `performOperation` — the SAME instance the canvas edit handlers
 * use — exposed to panels (which take no props) so an in-place op like
 * signing routes through the ONE flow instead of duplicating the snapshot/
 * commit choreography (and drifting from it). The publication receipt is the
 * exact accepted file revision, even if another revision becomes current before
 * the caller resumes. A `following` sequence is one edit and one undo entry.
 *
 * Resolves with the ENGINE's own answer, not with nothing: an operation that
 * reports what it could not do — a partial conversion, a count of what changed
 * — has no other way to reach the surface that must say so, and a caller
 * holding only `void` can state only what it asked for. `null` means the path
 * named no open file, so no operation ran.
 *
 * `EDIT_DECLINED` means the SIGNED-DOCUMENT decision stopped it: this flow
 * takes that decision itself, from the op's own class (`lib/op-edit-class`),
 * so no surface has to remember to ask and none can forget. Distinct from
 * `null` and from a throw because a caller showing "Applying…" has to know
 * which of the three happened — a silent return is visually indistinguishable
 * from success.
 *
 * `method` is the roster's key type, not `string`: an operation added without
 * an edit class does not compile. */
