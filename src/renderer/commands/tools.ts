// The shape of the change: 19 operations, grouped into 12 tools by the JOB the
// user came to do. The old rail's groups (Pages / Transform / Repair / Security
// / Content) were a taxonomy of the ENGINE — they named what the code does. A
// forms author does not think "I need a Content operation"; they think "I'm
// preparing a form". Tool titles use familiar, task-oriented vocabulary.
//
// Every operation the app has is reachable through exactly one tool — checked by
// a totality test, so an operation can't be orphaned by a future edit.
