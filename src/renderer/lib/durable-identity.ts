// Durable page/document identity.
//
// Two halves, both pure so they test without pdf.js:
//
// 1. GENERATION-TAGGED positional ids. Positional ids are re-derived on
//    every rebuild and were historically REUSED (`path#p2` came back
//    naming different content), which is why every id holder had to
//    hard-clear instead of prune — a stale id could re-bind to the wrong
//    physical page. Minting each positional index under a fresh per-path
//    generation makes stale matches IMPOSSIBLE by construction: after a
//    non-authored rebuild nothing survives, which is exactly the old
//    behavior, now enforced structurally.
//
// 2. AUTHORED-IDENTITY adoption. The JS page-tier commit builds the new
//    file FROM the pre-commit PageRefs, so it knows the old→new mapping;
//    `planCommit` publishes it and the post-commit reindex adopts the
//    old ids onto the FRESHLY-READ pages (ids only — dims/rotation/
//    annotations come from reading the baked bytes; the rotation
//    width/height swap is automatic that way). Validity is keyed on
//    BUFFER IDENTITY: the record names the exact committed buffer, so
//    any later buffer change makes it inert with no cleanup required.
