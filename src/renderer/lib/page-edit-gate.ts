// The page tier's signed-document gate — consulted BEFORE the gesture, the
// same posture every other edit surface takes.
//
// The page tier is the one edit tier whose write happens later: a rotate or a
// delete lands in memory and the file is rebuilt at commit time, where
// `transplant_incremental` either carries the delta as an appended revision
// (the signature survives) or refuses (the rebuild lands and every byte range
// breaks). So the question a gesture has to ask is not "is this document
// signed" but "will this document's signature survive THIS delta" — which is
// why the decision is delta-aware rather than a bare signed check.
//
// DOM-free by construction: there is no DOM test environment, so a rule
// inside a component is a rule with no test. The dialog belongs to the
// caller; this returns the same `SignedEditDecision` shape the whole-file
// tier already renders.
