/**
 * On-canvas article-bead draw.
 *
 * An article thread is an ordered list of rectangles ("beads") across pages;
 * the engine (`engine/threads.py`) wants each one in PDF user space against
 * the UNROTATED page. The band arrives display-normalised (0..1 of the drawn
 * frame, y from the TOP — the frame every other banded gesture uses), so a
 * conversion sits between them, and it is here rather than in a component
 * because there is no DOM test environment: the arithmetic is where the
 * mistakes live, so the arithmetic is what gets pinned.
 *
 * The band -> user-space conversion is `crop-draw.ts`'s `pageRectFromBand`,
 * shared with link authoring rather than restated here — two implementations
 * of the quarter-turn rule is how a landscape scan gets its geometry on the
 * wrong axis.
