// Is a usable Ghostscript configured? — the renderer's ONE answer.
//
// Ghostscript is a user-supplied prerequisite: the distribution provides
// none. Three resolvers used to answer this question independently — the
// settings panel's `ensureGsPath`, `ocr-recognize.ghostscriptPath`, and a
// direct `app.getGsPath()` in the scan dialog — and each returned a PATH,
// which is a string a spawn can fail on rather than an answer a surface can
// render. This module returns the capability instead, and every gs-bearing
// surface asks it.
//
// It is a LEAF module for the same reason `app-settings.ts` is one: the OCR
// door, the command registry's `when` predicates and the batch tier all need
// the answer, and importing a panel component for it drags module-level
// theme and IPC side effects into the command layer and into vitest, which
// has no `window`. Nothing here may touch React, the DOM, or a component.
//
// The answer is LIVE: installing Ghostscript and pointing the setting at it
// lights every dependent surface up in place. Two halves make that work — a
// synchronous snapshot for render-time and `when`-predicate reads, and a
// subscription every surface re-renders on when a probe lands.
