// Count & takeoff math: the symbol registry, group merging,
// sequence allocation, the derived tallies, and the legend table's layout.
//
// PURE — no DOM, no React, no storage (the `measure.ts` / `snap.ts`
// precedent). There is no DOM test environment in this repo, so the breakable
// part has to be the testable part; everything here is exercised directly by
// `tests/count-marks.test.ts`.
//
// Two rules that shape the whole module:
//
//   • **A tally is DERIVED, never stored.** Nothing carries a total — the
//     panel, the legend and the engine's CSV each COUNT the marks in front of
//     them. A stored total is a total that goes stale the next click.
//   • **A group's identity is its NAME, and the FILE is the authority on what
//     that group looks like.** Marks reconstitute from `/Subj` + `/C` +
//     `/SpectraSymbol` on import, so a document counted on another machine
//     opens with its groups intact — which means a locally-remembered group
//     of the same name must NOT re-colour the marks already in the file
//     (`mergeGroups` below).

// ── The symbol registry ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Vector, deliberately: a count marker must print crisply at any scale and
// lands in the annotation's appearance stream as path operators. The parts
// are expressed in a UNIT square (0..1, y DOWN — display orientation), which
// both consumers draw without a translation table: the canvas overlay as an
// SVG in a `0 0 1 1` viewBox, and `pdfx-build` as `m`/`l`/`c` operators
// scaled by the appearance BBox. One geometry, two renderers, no drift.
//
// The stamp library's third (vector) species generalizes this;
// the shape here is the shape that generalizes — an id plus parts.
