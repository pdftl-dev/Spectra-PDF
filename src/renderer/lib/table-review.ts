// Detected tables — the review model, pure over data.
//
// A detected table is a SUGGESTION with the field-candidate lifetime: transient
// view state bound to a page id, invalidated when its file's bytes change, and
// carrying nothing into any output until the user accepts it. Nothing here ever
// touches the PDF: the reviewed set is a parameter to the spreadsheet export,
// and the export writes only its own file.
//
// TWO FRAMES, and the split is the whole of this module's geometry.
//
// The table's BOUNDS are display-normalized with the rotation they were
// detected at, exactly as a field candidate's rect is — the canvas already owns
// one conversion between page space and the cell, and a second one here would
// be a second answer to where a rectangle is.
//
// Its COLUMN and ROW lines are fractions of the bounds in UN-ROTATED USER
// SPACE, which is where the detector reports them and where the export reads
// them back. Storing them in the cell's frame instead would bake a quarter turn
// into a number the engine never rotated, and a page turned after detection
// would export the columns as rows. Which way a line is DRAWN is therefore a
// question about the current rotation, answered by `placeColumn`/`placeRow`.
//
// Fractions rather than absolute positions are what makes a bounds drag
// coherent: dragging the table's trailing edge carries its interior boundaries
// with it instead of leaving them where they no longer describe the table.
