// Search & Redact: the panel's model.
//
// THE ARCHITECTURAL DECISION, in one line: **Search & Redact produces MARKS,
// it does not produce a redaction.** Every checked hit becomes an ordinary
// `RedactionMark` in exactly the shape the canvas band already produces, and
// from there the SHIPPED path takes over — the status bar's apply / save
// marks / clear, `buildRedactionRegions`, the commit gate, `performOperation`'s
// snapshot/undo chain and the `/Redact` persistence. No second destructive
// path is created, the transient-marks invariant is untouched, and the user
// gets the review step for free: marks are visible, movable, removable and
// undoable before anything is destroyed, which is how a redaction job is
// actually done.
//
// This module is the PURE half — hit identity, the selection model, the
// already-marked comparison and the word-list parser. Everything geometric
// lives on the canvas (`CanvasServices.redaction`), because the conversion
// from a page-space rect to a display-normalized mark is the seed's own
// conversion and there must be exactly one of it.
