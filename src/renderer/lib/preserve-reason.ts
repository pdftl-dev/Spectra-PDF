// Why a signed document's commit could NOT be appended — carried from the
// engine to the notice that has to say so.
//
// `transplant_incremental` has always answered with a reason and the renderer
// has always thrown it away: `preserveSignatures` returned a bare boolean, so
// a rotate on a signed document fell back to the full rewrite, broke every
// byte range, and told the user nothing until they reopened the signature
// panel. The reason is the whole difference between "the signature is gone"
// and "the signature is gone BECAUSE the document is certified against this".
//
// The reasons are stable engine ENUM names, not display text, and are matched
// as raw wire values — the same contract `SignedEditReason` already keeps. A
// name this build does not know is passed through verbatim rather than
// guessed at, which is the engine-message table's own posture for a message
// it cannot recognize.
//
// DOM-free: the mapping is a rule, and a rule inside a component is a rule
// with no test.
