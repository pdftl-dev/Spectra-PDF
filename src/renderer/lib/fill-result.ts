// field with no XFA node all raise, and no file is written. What it returns on
// the success path is therefore a REPORT, and the report is the only thing that
// can say the write covered what was asked for. Announcing success without
// reading it means a fill that wrote fewer fields than were named — or that
// answered with a shape this app cannot read at all — is presented to the user
// as done.
//
// There is no DOM test environment, so the decision lives here and the panels
// only render it (the selectors precedent).
