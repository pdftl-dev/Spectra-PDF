// The workspace is SETTLED when every document was indexed from the buffer
// its file holds now. Documents that were not would be superseded: their page
// indexes and rotations describe the previous bytes, while every reader of
// `files` already sees the new ones. A commit planned from superseded
// documents writes the wrong page for a moved index, applies a baked rotation
// a second time, and authors a baked annotation again beside itself — so a
// commit plans only once settled. Every byte replacement places, in the same
// step, documents that describe its bytes — read from them (an operation, a
// disk undo or redo) or composed for them (a page-tier commit) — or none (an
// open, which the indexer reads). A page-tier commit's composed documents
// (provisional) carry no fingerprint of what it wrote, so they wait for the
// read-back.
//
// DOM-free and pdf.js-free, so the rule tests in Node.
