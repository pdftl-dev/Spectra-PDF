// The decisions a form submission makes, apart from the dialog that shows them
// and the Rust client that performs the request.
//
// Two of them, and both are the security posture rather than plumbing:
//
//   • What is SENT. The request is built from the action's own format and the
//     payload the engine already wrote — a file, a content type and a
//     destination. Nothing here reads a field, because the payload builder
//     (`export_form_data`) is the only thing that ever does; the dialog shows
//     that file's bytes, so what the user sees is what transmits.
//   • What is DONE with what comes back. A response is untrusted bytes routed
//     by its declared content type into a door the app already has: the form
//     data import, the ordinary open funnel, or a saved file for the system
//     browser. There is no fourth answer, and an unknown type takes the
//     saved-file one — the door that interprets nothing.
//
// Pure, so both are pinned by tests rather than by clicking.
