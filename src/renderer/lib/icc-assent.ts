// Has the bundled colour profiles' licence been accepted? — the renderer's
// ONE answer.
//
// The profiles ship under a bundling agreement whose Exhibit B end-user
// licence has to be PRESENTED to the user and accepted. The installer does
// that through its licence page (or `/acceptEULA` when unattended) and records
// the answer beside the executable, so an installed copy never asks again. A
// portable copy has no installer, so the application presents the same text on
// first run and records the answer itself.
//
// `gs-capability.ts` is the model and the reason for the shape: a LEAF module
// (no React, no DOM, no component imports) holding a synchronous snapshot for
// render-time reads plus a subscription, so accepting lights every dependent
// surface up in place rather than at the next launch.
//
// Three surfaces depend on a bundled profile: the destination a CMYK
// conversion converts to, the `/DestOutputProfile` a PDF/X output intent
// embeds, and the press an output preview soft-proofs against. Declining
// leaves all three NAMED-DISABLED — the Ghostscript posture — and leaves every
// other capability in the product untouched.
