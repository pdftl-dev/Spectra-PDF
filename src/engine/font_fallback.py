"""Replacement-font fallback.

When a run's own font cannot express the user's text (subset without the
glyph, symbolic encoding…), the edit is re-rendered in the BUNDLED
Liberation Sans (OFL; vendored by scripts/sync-edit-fonts.ps1, resolved by
the Rust `get_edit_font_path`) — subsetted to exactly the characters used
and embedded as a Type0/Identity-H font with a generated ToUnicode CMap,
so the output stays extractable/searchable (the same capability bar the
rest of Edit Text holds).

Embedding shape (the standard modern composite-font construction):
  Type0 (Identity-H, ToUnicode)
    └ CIDFontType2 (CIDToGIDMap /Identity, /W from hmtx, FontDescriptor
      with FontFile2 = the subsetted TrueType bytes)
CID == GID by construction: text encodes as 2-byte glyph ids straight from
the subsetted font's cmap.

The run rewrite itself reuses text_runs' targeted rewriter through its
builder hook: this module only supplies "how to render the replacement" —
`/NewFont size Tf`, the GID-encoded Tj, and a Tf restoring the run's
original font so subsequent runs are untouched. Δwidth math, same-line
anchor adjustment, and form copy-on-edit are the SAME code paths the
run editor uses.

    Vertical CJK could not be restyled at all because "no vertical face is
    bundled". One is bundled now (Noto Sans CJK carries `vert`/`vrt2`,
    `vmtx` and `VORG`) and the shaper can reach those features, so the
    stated reason stopped being true and this is what replaces it.

    Three things make an embed vertical rather than horizontal, and all
    three come from the font rather than from an assumption:

      - the glyphs are the VERTICAL forms, which is a GSUB substitution the
        shaper applies when the buffer runs top-to-bottom (a comma becomes
        its upright variant; brackets rotate);
      - the advance is the vertical one from `vmtx`, reported by the shaper
        as a negative `y_advance` — `/W2` carries its magnitude;
      - the /Encoding is **Identity-V**, which is what tells the VIEWER to
        advance downward. Emitting vertical glyphs under a horizontal CMap
        would draw the right shapes marching across the page.

    Returns (font_dict, encode, width_1000) with the same shape as
    `build_fallback_font`, so every caller's width and emission code is

    a shaped run addresses glyphs the cmap cannot reach (a joining form, a
    lam-alef ligature, an attached mark).

    `shaped` is a list of `engine.shaping.ShapedRun`. The subset RETAINS the
    source glyph ids so a glyph can be addressed by the id the shaper handed
    back (the subsetter drops the `post` names that would otherwise let us

    those ids.

    That indirection is the whole point, and it is not optional. What a glyph
    SPELLS is a property of the (glyph, cluster) PAIR, not of the glyph:
    HarfBuzz folds a combining mark into its base's cluster, so one base
    glyph spells `مَ` here and `مْ` three words later. /ToUnicode is keyed by
    CODE, so giving each distinct pair its own code lets both spellings
    coexist — where keying by glyph id silently let the second overwrite the
    first, and a fatha came back as a sukun. Several codes mapping to one
    glyph is exactly what a CIDToGIDMap stream is for.

    Each cluster's CARRIER code takes that cluster's characters and its
    companions map to the EMPTY string, so an Arabic letter drawn as
    base-plus-mark still extracts as exactly its characters, once. That is
    what keeps a shaped edit re-editable — the round trip is the feature,
