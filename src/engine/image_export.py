"""Export PDF pages as raster images via Ghostscript (image half).

Why Ghostscript and not the LibreOffice route the Office exports use:
LibreOffice's CLI image export renders the FIRST page only — useless for a
multi-page document. The gs raster is the same one already trusted for visual
compare (`compare.py`) and printing, and renders every page.

Formats:
  png / jpeg — one file PER PAGE. The user's chosen name is treated as the
      naming template: a single rendered page gets exactly that name; multiple
      pages get ``<stem>-<n><ext>`` via gs's ``%d`` output template (1-based,
      numbered in RENDER order — page 3 of a "3,5" selection is ``-1``).
  tiff — ONE multi-page file (tiff24nc / tifflzw-gray), the archival shape.

The user's own ``%`` characters in the output name are escaped (``%%``) before
our ``%d`` is appended — gs treats ``%`` as a template character, and a name
like "Q4 50% off.png" would otherwise silently splinter. Page selection reuses
the print dialog's strict ``parse_page_spec``: a lax parse turns a typo into a
whole-document run.

Every page is framed on its CropBox, which is the page the viewer shows. An
image of the MediaBox of a cropped page is the wrong size and carries the
margin the crop exists to hide, so the exported file does not depict the page
the user was looking at when they asked for it.
