"""Complex-script shaping (HarfBuzz) for the paragraph reflow.

A PDF viewer does NOT shape: the content stream already carries the final
glyph selections, so re-emitting Arabic text as its base letters draws the
ISOLATED forms of every letter — a word that reads as a row of disconnected
stumps. That is broken output, not a narrow limitation, which is why RTL
reflow could not ship on bidi reordering alone.

So the reflow shapes. `uharfbuzz` (Apache-2.0) is HarfBuzz itself, the same
engine used by browsers, and it answers the only two questions
the layout asks: WHICH glyphs, and HOW WIDE. Everything here is a thin,
honest wrapper around that:

  ``requires_shaping(text)``  — does this text belong to a cursively joining
      script? A property of the TEXT, not the font, so it is decidable before
      any font is resolved (which is what the fallback ladder needs).
  ``can_shape_in_place(...)`` — can the document's OWN embedded program drive
      the shaper, and are its glyph ids usable as PDF character codes? True
      keeps the document's typeface; False sends the run to the bundled face.
  ``shape(...)``              — glyph names + the total advance, per word.

Two conventions the callers depend on:

  - Shaping runs PER WORD. Cursive joining never crosses a space, so a word
    is the largest unit whose shaping is independent of its neighbours —
    which means the line breaker can move words freely without invalidating
    a single glyph. (Shaping a whole line and then breaking it would.)
  - Advances come from the shaper in font units and are returned per 1000/em,
    the unit every width path in this engine already speaks.

What this module deliberately does NOT do: GPOS mark positioning offsets
(x_offset/y_offset) are dropped, because expressing them needs a per-glyph
text-matrix push that the emission has no shape for. Dropping the
offsets degrades vowel-mark placement on
fully-vocalised text rather than corrupting the letters.

        composing a base and a combining mark into one precomposed glyph);
      * a glyph carries a positioning OFFSET (`mark`/`mkmk` attaching a

    it keeps the emission byte-identical for the overwhelming majority of

    """Whether `face_path` shapes `text` without hitting `.notdef` — the
    ladder's probe, so a face that merely CONTAINS the letters but not their
    joining forms is not mistaken for a working one.

    The probe runs in the TEXT's own direction. It used to take
    `shape`'s right-to-left default, which is correct for every joining
    script but Mongolian — and a probe that shapes backwards answers about a
    run nobody will draw.

    Structural whitespace is a line break, not a glyph: it never embeds and
    is never shaped, so the probe must not ask the face about it. It used to,
    and the face answered `.notdef` — which failed the probe for every
    MULTI-LINE box mixing a joining script with anything else, sent the
    resolution back to a Latin face, and turned into "the fallback font
    cannot express" for text a bundled face draws perfectly on one line. The
    substitution keeps the word boundaries the per-word shaping relies on."""
