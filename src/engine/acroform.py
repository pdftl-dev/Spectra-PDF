"""AcroForm helpers for structural page operations.

pikepdf's raw page copies (``pages.append``/``extend``) import widget
annotations and their /Parent field chains but never the document-level
/AcroForm — merge and split outputs lost every form field (still rendering
via /AP pixels; nothing fillable, every /V orphaned), and delete could leave
phantom fields whose every widget died with a deleted page. pikepdf itself
flags the copy hazard (PageCopyWarning) and, since 10.x, ships the fix:
``Pdf.add_pages_from``. Its per-page field-copy maps, however, fork a field
whose widgets span pages. merge/split/Combine subsets use
``page_copy.copy_pages_with_forms`` instead: one qpdf transform_annotations
batch per source, then add_and_rename_fields. This retains upstream /DR
collision handling, /DA rewriting, inherited defaults and /NeedAppearances,
while retaining one field identity across all selected pages. This module
covers the remaining document-level behavior:

- ``prune_form_to_pages`` — prune field trees to kept pages, in place. Used
  by split BEFORE the copy (add_pages_from carries a partially-selected
  field as its ENTIRE subtree, leaving phantom dead widgets for the excluded
  pages' kids — pruning first yields clean trees and an empty
  ``partial_fields``) and by delete AFTER page removal (with every remaining
  page kept, so widgets of deleted pages drop out).
- ``carry_pure_data_fields`` — widget-less pure-data fields (a /V with no
  page presence) are dropped by add_pages_from because it discovers fields
  through page widgets; dropping them would silently discard their /V, so
  they are carried explicitly. The renderer's rebuild keeps them for the
  same reason (lib/acroform-carry.ts — one semantic, two object models).
- ``refresh_sig_flags`` — /SigFlags is not recomputed upstream; bit 1
  (SignaturesExist) is re-derived from the surviving fields, and bit 2 is
  dropped — its precondition, an unbroken signature, cannot survive page
  surgery.

Document-level form behavior:

- ``carry_doc_form_extras`` — /CO (calculation order) is RECONCILED, not
  blind-carried: each entry resolves to its fully-qualified field name
  source-side, follows ``add_pages_from``'s rename report, and re-binds to
  the destination's copied field object; entries whose field did not
  survive drop out. The document catalog's /AA (document-action scripts)
  is document-scoped, not page-scoped — it carries whole, first source
  with one wins (the /DA//Q first-contributor rule).
- ``prune_form_to_pages`` reconciles an in-place /CO the same way after
  pruning (delete's path).
- ``reattach_acroform`` (the 1:1 gs-regeneration path) carries /CO, the
  catalog /AA, AND /XFA verbatim — page identity is preserved there, so
  the XFA packet still agrees with the pages.
- ``refuse_if_xfa`` — page SURGERY (merge/split/delete, the renderer's
  commit rebuild) REFUSES XFA documents outright: the XFA template lays
  out its own pages, so a restructured PDF page tree and a carried-verbatim
  XFA packet describe two different documents (a reader that honors XFA
  shows an unedited layout, causing silent cross-reader divergence). A stated
  refusal avoids both silent /XFA loss and a carried lie. Fill's pure-AcroForm
  posture
  (/XFA stripped by pdf-lib, detected and stated) is a separate,
  unchanged boundary.

Field-level keys (incl. per-field /AA) travel with the field objects
untouched, as always.
