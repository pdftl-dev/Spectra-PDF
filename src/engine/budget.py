"""Derived subprocess time budgets.

A FIXED wall-clock budget on a whole-document render fails on exactly the
documents the feature exists for. the reporter hit `timeout=300` on a
50 MB smartphone scan — the normal case for scanned-document work, not an
outlier — and the same fixed 300 s appears across the Ghostscript-backed ops.

So a budget is DERIVED from the work: a floor, plus an allowance per megabyte
of input and per page. The computed number is named in the timeout message,
which is what keeps a genuine hang distinguishable from a slow job: "gave up
after 300s" says nothing, while "did not finish within the derived budget
(940s, 52.1 MB, 210 pages)" says the job was given time proportional to its
size and still did not return.

    purpose — a per-op table would drift, and the honest statement is "time
    proportional to the work", not "this op is special".

    **The floor is the family's OWN old constant, and that is deliberate.**

    ones get more. Lowering the floor would have converted a slow-but-passing
    small job into a new failure — fixing a timeout by introducing one.

    Ghostscript is user-supplied, so this is also where its availability is
    decided: `cmd[0]` is validated by `gs_capability` and REPLACED with the
    validated path before anything spawns. Deciding it here rather than at
    each door is what makes the refusal one message instead of a dozen
