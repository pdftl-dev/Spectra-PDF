"""Which standard clause each shipped check decides, and on whose authority.

A check that fires is evidence about a clause only if the clause is named. This
table names it, and names the SOURCE of the citation with it, because the two
families of citation here do not carry the same weight.

TWO SOURCE KINDS, AND WHY THEY ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE

``held``   the clause text is in this repository's normative set (ISO 32000-2,
           ISO 14289-1/-2). The citation is the standard's own numbering.
``corpus`` the standard is NOT held. ISO 19005 (PDF/A) is cited by number and
           title only, taken from the conformance corpus' own organisation,
           which is arranged as that standard's table of contents. This is a
           RECORDED GAP, not a normative reading: a ``corpus`` citation says
           where the requirement is filed, never what its text says.

WHAT A COVERAGE LABEL CLAIMS

``full``    the check's condition IS the clause's requirement.
``partial`` the check decides a STRICT SUBSET of the requirement: it can miss a
            violation, and it can never flag a file the clause permits.

No citation may admit a FALSE ALARM. A check that fails a file its cited clause
allows is not a partial implementation of that clause — it is a different rule
wearing the clause's number, and `scripts/pdfa-scoreboard.py` reports one as a
defect rather than as coverage. That asymmetry is the whole discipline: an
incomplete check understates conformance, an over-broad one asserts a
non-conformance the standard does not state.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT

`output_intent` decides presence of an output intent with an embedded profile.
PDF/A requires one only where device colour spaces are used, so as configured
the check would fail conformant files that use none. It is therefore cited
against no PDF/A clause at all rather than cited as ``partial``.

`fonts_subset` requires subsetting. PDF/A does not; its font-subset clause
constrains subsets that exist. Same rule, opposite direction, so no citation.

`interactive_form` forbids form fields outright. PDF/A constrains forms rather
than forbidding them, so the check is not a subset of that clause either.

`live_transparency` was cited against the PDF/A-1 transparency clause and the
corpus removed the citation: it fails a file the suite passes, whose alpha
constants are `0.9999999` and `1.0000001` — one part in ten million from
opaque, and inside the real-number precision a PDF writer is held to. The
check is right for a press (it reports what the file says) and wrong as a
conformance verdict (it flags a file the clause permits), which is exactly the
false-alarm case no citation may admit. Recorded rather than quietly dropped:
the check is unchanged and the clause is uncovered.

`fonts_embedded` was cited against the font-embedding clauses of three parts
and the corpus removed all three the same way: it fails a passing file whose
one unembedded font is drawn only in text rendering mode 3, which puts no mark
on the page. The check reports every font a resource dictionary declares,
which is the fact a press wants; the clause is about fonts that render. Not a
defect in the check — no shipped profile is a PDF/A profile, so no shipped
verdict is wrong — but not a subset of the clause either, so it is not cited.
The same file shape occurs in ordinary work: a scanned page whose OCR text
layer is invisible and unembedded.

The unmapped checks are enumerated by `unmapped_preflight_checks()` rather than
left implicit — a coverage figure whose denominator hides its own gaps is the
thing this table exists to stop.
