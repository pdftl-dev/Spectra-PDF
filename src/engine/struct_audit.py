"""The structure tree as the accessibility checker needs to read it.

`get_struct_tree` lists the tree for an editor: types, the four text
properties, and the content each element references. A conformance check needs
three things that listing does not carry:

  * **attribute dictionaries** — `/A` holds `/Scope`, `/Headers`, `/Summary`,
    `/ColSpan` and `/RowSpan`, singly or as an array, optionally paired with
    revision numbers and keyed by an owner (`/O /Table`). Producers also write
    those keys directly on the element, so both places are read and the
    attribute dictionaries win;
  * **resolved OBJR targets** — an `/OBJR` names an annotation, and "is this
    annotation tagged" is a question about which one;
  * **resolved roles and heading levels** — through `/RoleMap`, and for the
    generic `H` through nesting depth.

The last of those is `derived_nav`'s, and it is IMPORTED rather than rewritten:
two implementations of one levelling rule drift the moment nothing compares
them. Paths are `get_struct_tree`'s own numbering, so a finding addresses the
node the Tags panel selects.
