"""Embed a font the document names but does not carry.

Nineteen of the twenty preflight fixups are an existing op called with the
parameters a profile carries. This is the twentieth, and it is built rather
than routed because nothing in this engine writes a font program into a font
the DOCUMENT already declares — the emitters all author their own.

Four rules govern it, and each one is a defect if it is missed.

**An exact face, or a refusal — never a substitute.** ``font_fallback`` is
what this app uses to DRAW a font it does not have, and drawing is reversible.
Writing a substitute's program into the file under the original's name is not:
every reader downstream then believes the document carries the face it names.
With ``allow_substitute`` explicitly on, a substitute is written AND the
report names it, per font.

**The document's ``/Widths`` win.** A resolved face whose advances disagree
with the widths the document already declares would reflow every line it sets,
so the disagreement refuses BY NAME rather than being embedded and discovered
on press. The comparison runs at every code the document declares an advance
for, which is a superset of the codes it draws — strictness here can only
refuse an embed, never permit a silent metric change.

**A restricted face refuses with the foundry's own reason**, read off the
``fsType`` ``system_fonts`` already resolves, never skipped silently.

**Refusal is per font, not per document.** Four missing fonts of which three
are installed embeds three and names the fourth. A run in which nothing
embedded and something refused raises, so a caller asking for one fixup gets
that fixup's own refusal rather than an empty success — the
``accessibility_fixes`` rule.
