"""The document-wide half of applying a redaction.

The page walk rewrites what each redacted page draws. What it cannot see from a
page is everything else in the file that still holds, points at or describes
the content it removed — and ISO 32000-2 §12.5.6.23 requires a redactor to
remove every trace of that content and to account for every place content can
live in a document. This module is that pass, run once after every page:

  - STRUCTURE. A structure element that names a replaced image or form as its
    whole content (an OBJR, §14.7.5.3) or holds a marked-content reference into
    a replaced form (an MCR's /Stm, §14.7.5.2) keeps the ORIGINAL reachable, and
    so its bytes in the saved file. Each such reference is rebound to the
    redacted copy, or removed when the object went whole — unless the original
    is still drawn somewhere, in which case it stays and every copy gives up
    the /StructParent key that is the original's. An OBJR to an annotation the
    page pass removed goes, with nothing to rebind to. An element whose content
    was redacted — found through the parent tree, or through its own /K where
    the file has no parent tree — also loses /Alt, /ActualText and /E: a
    description of a picture or a replacement for text says what was under the
    mark.
  - SHARED RESOURCES. One resource dictionary is often shared by every page —
    by reference, or inherited from a /Pages node — and by the forms on them.
    Wherever it still lists an original a redacted page replaced, its owner
    (a page, a form, a pattern, a Type 3 font) takes its own copy pruned to
    what that owner draws; one that draws the original keeps it, because it
    shows it outside every mark. Otherwise the original stays in the saved
    file with nothing drawing it.
  - FORM FIELDS. A widget under a mark is removed with its annotation (the page
    pass). A field left with no widget at all loses its value, default value
    and option list and leaves the field tree. The XFA packet is dropped from a
    form that lost a field: its datasets carry every value in one XML stream.
  - JBIG2. A redacted image re-encodes its JBIG2 stencil and stops using the
    shared symbol dictionary (/JBIG2Globals), but the dictionary itself holds
    symbol bitmaps, and a symbol whose only instances were under the mark —
    a signature's strokes, a handwritten note — would outlive it there. Every
    other image that uses that dictionary is converted to CCITT group 4 (the
    same bitmap, proved by decoding it back), so the dictionary drops out.
  - DERIVATIVES. The catalog's /PieceInfo can hold an authoring application's
    private copy of the whole document; the document XMP can hold
    xmp:Thumbnails, a raster of a page as it was. Both go.
  - FONTS. A font keeps the glyph program of every character it drew, and its
    tables name those characters. Every font whose use shrank is cut to what
    the remaining text draws (`redact_fonts`).
