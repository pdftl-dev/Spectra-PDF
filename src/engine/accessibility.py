"""Accessibility checker — 56 checks across seven categories.

A check is a CLAIM, and every claim states how it was reached. Each check
yields one of five verdicts and, when it has something to name, a list of
findings, each carrying an address the app can jump to.

Two rules govern the whole inventory.

**`pass` is never the fallback.** ``not_applicable`` is a state of its own: a
document with no tables has nothing to say about table headers, and reporting
"passed" for a check with nothing to check is how a report earns a score it
did not earn. Those rows are excluded from the pass tally, and the summary
says so by carrying `applicable` separately from `total`.

**A check that can be wrong reports ``needs_review``, never ``fail``.** A
false failure on a conforming document destroys the only thing this tool
sells. Colour contrast over an unresolvable backdrop, a reading order that
merely disagrees with geometry, a script that might flash the screen — each is
reported with its inventory so a human reviews a list rather than a document.

**A read that did not complete is a third state, not a clean one.** A page
whose content stream will not parse lands in ``unreadable``; an annotation
list, a field tree, a script site or a branch of the structure tree that will
not read is named on the checks that consumed it. Every such check degrades to
``needs_review``: "could not read" is never reported as "nothing found", and
an empty inventory that came out of a failed read is never reported as
``not_applicable``.

**A check states which standard it speaks for.** `CHECK_SOURCES` carries the
clause behind every check, and the kind of claim that clause supports: a
`shall` fails, a `should` warns, and a check neither ISO 14289-1 nor
ISO 32000-2 states at all is a practice this checker keeps under its own name
rather than a conformance verdict wearing someone else's authority.

Every walk here is bounded — the field tree by ``_FIELD_TREE_DEPTH``, the
structure tree by ``struct_tree._MAX_DEPTH`` and its cycle guard — and a bound
that was reached is reported rather than presented as the end of the document.

Addresses come in three kinds, each matching a jump the app already performs:
``struct`` (a structure-tree path in `get_struct_tree`'s numbering),
``content`` ({page, rect} and a run index) and ``object`` ({page,
annotation} or {field}). A path never outlives the tree it was read from, so
the report is re-run on every buffer change and a finding whose address no
longer resolves surfaces a notice rather than retargeting.
