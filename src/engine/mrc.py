"""ITU-T T.44 mixed-raster-content compression.

A scanned page is a photograph OF text. Storing it as one continuous-tone
image forces a single trade: keep the resolution and keep the size, or drop
both. MRC splits the page into the three layers T.44 names and encodes each
with the codec it actually suits —

  * a 1-bit **stencil** at SOURCE resolution saying where ink is (JBIG2, or
    CCITT G4), which is why the output reads sharper than the JPEG it came
    from: the glyph edges become a binary shape instead of a chroma-
    subsampled gradient;
  * a small **foreground** carrying the ink COLOUR, drawn through the
    stencil as a `/Mask`;
  * a small **background** carrying the paper, inpainted so the text leaves
    no ghost behind it, and coded at FIXED quality
    (`mrc_codecs.encode_layer_jpx`) so that a partial redaction keeps every
    background pixel beyond the wavelet's reach around the mark.

The scan image's `Do` is replaced
in the page's own content stream by two `Do`s (`page_images.
replace_placement_with_layers`). The page OBJECT survives, so /Annots,
/AcroForm and its field tree, /StructTreeRoot and the marked-content ids the
layers now sit inside, page labels and the outline all carry through with
nothing to reattach. This must remain an in-place content edit rather than a
page-image rebuild, which would discard document structure.

Correctness constraints:

1. **The background must be averaged over PAPER pixels only.** Filling the
   ink holes with a blur of the whole image leaves a text ghost and collapses
   contrast. The correct form is a masked box filter,
   `blur(I·paper) / blur(paper)`, pyramided so a block with no paper in it
   still fills from a coarser level.
2. **Segmentation is a MEASUREMENT of the page, not a constant.** The
   Sauvola window is sized from the page's own median glyph height (a first
   pass at a default window measures it, a second pass uses it), because a
   window sized for 10 pt text erodes 24 pt text and a window sized for a
   heading smears body copy into one blob.
3. **A photograph is not text and must never enter the stencil.** A
   halftone put into a 1-bit mask both bloats it and moirés on screen; a
   continuous-tone photograph put there posterizes. Both are excluded and
   left to the background, and the background's resolution rises to carry
   them.
4. **Every mask is decode-verified before it is embedded.**
   `verify_mask_stream` uses Ghostscript as an independent decoder. A
   multi-strip G4 stream renders as a plausibly eroded page and an inverted
   stencil renders solid black that OCR still returns words from, so a size
   check and a "does it render" check both pass over either. A page whose
   mask fails verification is left UNTOUCHED and says so.

#: Named for what they promise, not for a number.
#:
#: `sauvola_k` is CONSERVATIVE at the low end: Sauvola's threshold is
#: `m·(1 + k·(σ/R − 1))` and σ < R over paper, so the bracket is negative and
#: a LARGER k lowers the threshold and finds LESS ink. Archival therefore runs
#: the smallest k — it keeps thin strokes, at the cost of keeping some paper
#: texture with them.
#:
#: `verify_threshold` is the floor `mrc_verify_text` reverts below,
#: and it is set to catch a SEGMENTATION FAILURE, not an OCR wobble. Measured
#: over six sources × three presets × three codecs: the WORST good page any
#: preset produced scored 0.9781 (the
#: greyscale scan under archival), while the failure this gate exists for — a
#: page thresholded for type that is not there — returns near-nothing, which
#: is why a misjudged page scores in the low hundredths. The floors sit
#: between those two populations with room to spare. **0.98 was the first
#: value here and the matrix caught it**: it would have REVERTED that
#: greyscale page, handing the user back the original they asked to shrink —
#: a false revert is its own silent degradation, and setting the floor at the
#: measured best case is how you build one.
#:
#: `bg_step` and `bg_levels` are the background's fixed quantizer step and
#: wavelet depth (`mrc_codecs.encode_layer_jpx`). A larger step is a smaller
#: file; every subband's step is rounded to a power of two, so two steps
#: closer than a half-octave can write the same bytes. A partial redaction
#: destroys the mark plus `5 * 2**bg_levels - 4` background pixels around it,
#: and each level fewer quadruples the coefficients coded exactly.
