"""Text-run listing and in-place replacement (Edit Text).

A "run" is one text-showing operator (Tj / ' / " / TJ), the unit the user
clicks. Ids are the DFS show-op encounter order (page stream first, forms
recursed at their Do position) — the same index-agreement discipline as
page_images.py, proven there and pinned here by the same style of tests.

Listing decodes each run through its font's capability (pdf_fonts.py) and
computes REAL geometry: glyph advances from the font's widths (+ TJ kern,
Tc char spacing, Tw word spacing on the single-byte space code, Tz), so
run rects are accurate and the Δwidth math is honest. That measurement now
lives in `text_metrics.py` and REDACTION calls it too — the
flat-estimate era, when the two walkers disagreed about a run's width, ended
with a measured false negative; see that module's docstring.

The listing rect stays the EM box (baseline → baseline + font size): it is
the box the user clicks, and its top/bottom are where a caret belongs. The
INK box (`text_metrics.ink_extent_em`) is a different question and is what
redaction tests against — a lister rect misses 2.48 pt of descender at 12 pt
Helvetica, which is a click-target nicety and a redaction leak.

Replacement (`replace_text_run`) rewrites exactly one show op:
  - the new text re-encoded in the run's own font (ValueError names the
    first character the font cannot express — the renderer validates live
    against the run's `encodable` set, so this is a belt);
  - ' and " targets are expanded to their spec equivalence (T* [+ Tw/Tc
    for "]) followed by a plain Tj, preserving their state side effects;
  - the Δwidth anchor rule (the phase doc's design): text that FLOWS
    (consecutive shows, no repositioning) shifts automatically via the tm
    advance; subsequent SAME-LINE Td/TD anchors (ty == 0) are absolute
    against the line matrix and are shifted by Δ explicitly — the
    word-per-Td generator pattern would overlap a grown word otherwise.
    Any line change (T*, ', ", Td/TD with ty ≠ 0, Tm, BT, ET) stops the
    adjustment. Cross-line reflow belongs to the paragraph layer, deliberately.
  - vertical runs (Identity-V/UCS2-V capabilities) list with
    `vertical: true`, an em-wide column rect spanning the /W2 advance sum
    DOWNWARD, and the anchor rule TRANSPOSED: same-COLUMN Td/TD followers
    (tx == 0) shift by Δadvance in ty (unscaled — Tz never applies
    vertically); a tx change is a column boundary and stops.
  - a run inside a Form XObject edits a COPY of the form for that draw
    (the page_images.py pattern verbatim).

Empty `new_text` is allowed — it deletes the run's text (negative Δ pulls
same-line anchors back).
