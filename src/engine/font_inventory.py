"""Every font a document uses — the Properties dialog's Fonts tab.

Read-only enumeration. A font reaches the page through several resource
dictionaries, and a listing that only looked at ``page /Resources /Font`` would
miss most of the interesting ones: a logo's Form XObject keeps its own
resources, a Type3 glyph procedure keeps its own, an annotation's appearance
stream keeps its own, and a form's default appearance fonts live in
``/AcroForm /DR /Font``. All of them are walked.

What is reported per font: the name (subset prefix stripped for display), the
type, the encoding, whether the program is EMBEDDED, and — when it is known to
be absent — the face this app would actually substitute. That last field is
answered by ``font_fallback.resolve_fallback_font``, the resolver every emitter
in this engine already uses, so the tab names the face the app really draws
with rather than guessing at some other reader's system font.

``embedded`` is the shared tri-state (``font_embedding.font_embedded``): true,
false, or null where the font will not read. A null carries no substitution,
because the face a reader would fall back to is only knowable once the program
is known to be missing.
