"""Printer marks — crop marks, registration targets, colour bars, page info.

Marks are drawn OUTSIDE the trim, so the page has to GROW: a PDF page carries
no room outside its trim box by construction (`page_boxes.set_page_boxes`
clamps INSIDE the media box and cannot grow it), and every ordinary document
has a media box equal to its trim. `/MediaBox` therefore grows by
`offset + length` on every edge and `/CropBox` grows with it — a viewer clips
to the crop box and would hide the marks that were just drawn. `/TrimBox`,
`/BleedBox` and `/ArtBox` are never touched: they still describe the same
paper, which is the whole point of growing the other two.

The original boxes, `/Contents` and `/Resources` are recorded on the page
under one private key, so `remove_printer_marks` restores exactly what was
there — values and object identity, not a reconstruction. The boxes always
come from that record; the contents and resources do only while they are
still the objects the add wrote, because a wholesale restore over an edit
made since would silently revert it. Anything else takes the surgical path
and strips the mark draw out of what the page carries now. A second `add`
removes first, so two runs leave one mark set and one growth.

Crop marks, registration targets and page information paint in
`/Separation /All`, never in `0 0 0 1 k`. The separation device gives `/All`
no plate of its own and paints it onto every plate, so a mark drawn this way
reaches all four; a black one would reach the black plate alone and tell a
press operator nothing about registration. Colour bars are the deliberate
exception — a patch exists to show ONE ink, so a process patch paints in
DeviceCMYK and a spot patch in that spot's own `/Separation` space. A bar
whose spot set could not be established refuses: this writes a document, and
a printed sheet has no room to carry a caveat. A spot is the bytes of its
colorant name (ISO 32000-2 §7.3.5, §8.6.6.4): the patch paints the document's
own space object, so the plate it reaches is the one those bytes name, and
only the page-information line reads them as text.

`/AcroForm` is not at risk here: this appends content to existing pages and
copies no page, so no widget's field registration moves.
