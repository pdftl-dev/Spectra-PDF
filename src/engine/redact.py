"""True content redaction: remove what lies under a region from the content
itself, then paint the region's box over it — never just an overlay.

Per page, the content stream is walked with the graphics and text state
(`content_walk`) so every drawing operator's device-space footprint is known,
and each kind of content loses exactly the part under a mark:

  - TEXT is measured through its font (`text_metrics`, shared with the text
    lister): glyph advances plus TJ kerns, Tc, Tw and Tz, and the font's own
    ascent and descent. A show operator is SPLIT: the clusters whose boxes meet
    a mark go, the rest are re-shown from their original bytes, and each
    removed stretch becomes one TJ number with exactly the advance it had, so
    every surviving glyph stays put. A run the font cannot measure goes whole
    (`runs_removed_whole`), its box taken WIDE — 1 em per code.
  - An IMAGE (`Do` or inline) loses the pixels under the mark in a COPY
    (`image_redact`); only that occurrence is rewritten to the copy, and
    placements with the same plan share one copy. A mark over the whole
    placed area, or a placement with no area, removes the occurrence; an
    image whose encoding cannot be rewritten safely refuses by name before
    anything is written.
  - A PATH loses the area under the mark (`vector_redact`): fills are
    clipped, strokes are cut short of it, clip paths lose it too.
  - A FORM XObject, the group of a soft mask set by `gs`, and the cell of a
    tiling pattern painted under a mark are redacted as COPIES, registered
    under fresh names; the originals stay for any placement the mark does not
    reach. A copy carries only the keys that describe how to draw it
    (`FORM_KEPT_KEYS`, `PATTERN_KEPT_KEYS`).
  - A marked-content sequence that lost content loses its /ActualText, /Alt
    and /E, and its MCID is recorded so the structure element is scrubbed too.
  - A shading painted with `sh` whose clip meets a mark goes whole.

Then per page: the region boxes (with any overlay text) are painted on top;
the page's resource dictionary becomes its own, the copies are registered in
it, and every content-bearing category is pruned to the names the rewritten
stream still uses BEFORE qpdf's unreferenced-resource sweep — a replaced
original left listed stays reachable, and a form without /Resources that is
still listed keeps alive every name its content draws. Page-level derivatives
of the content go (`_PAGE_DERIVATIVES`), and annotations over a mark are
removed with their popups and replies.

Last, once per document (`redact_document.finish`): shared and inherited
resource dictionaries that still list a replaced original, structure
references to replaced objects, fields whose widgets were all removed, JBIG2
symbol dictionaries a redacted image used, the document's own thumbnails and
private data, and every font the removed text drew with, cut to what the
remaining text draws (`redact_fonts`, measured against a scan taken before the
first page changes).

Remaining limitations:
  - A glyph's box is its ADVANCE box. Ink can overhang the advance by a side
    bearing (an italic `f`, a swash), so a region touching ONLY that overhang
    and no part of the advance box does not remove the glyph. Bounding each
    glyph by the font's /FontBBox instead would be exact and useless — for
    Helvetica that box is 1.166 em wide, four times the advance of an `i`, so
    every mark would take several neighbouring glyphs with it.
  - Form, pattern and soft-mask recursion is depth-capped (MAX_FORM_DEPTH).
    Beyond the cap an intersecting `Do` is DROPPED WHOLE rather than left
    intact. Only reachable on pathological (cyclic) nesting.

    `images_removed_for_compression` (of the removed) were only partly marked
    but a lossy JPEG 2000 codestream ties every pixel to the mark. An image
    whose encoding cannot be rewritten safely raises instead (see
    `image_redact`), before anything is written, so the input keeps its bytes.
