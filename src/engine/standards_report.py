"""What a standards conversion changed, per document.

Ghostscript reaches PDF/A and PDF/X conformance partly by DELETING content it
cannot make conformant, and it is a producer rather than a validator: nothing
it emits certifies that its output conforms to the standard. Two facts shape
this module.

Its diagnostics are NECESSARY. A conversion that abandons the standard says so
in one line on stderr and nowhere else — the file it writes can still carry a
conformance key, because that key is written by the caller's own preamble and
the producer's retreat does not remove it. Suppressing or discarding that line
leaves a false claim as the only surviving evidence.

Its diagnostics are NOT SUFFICIENT. The sharpest alterations carry no message
at all: a page whose transparency cannot be represented at the requested
conformance level is rasterized whole, so every glyph on it stops being text,
and the producer reports nothing. An interactive form loses every field and
its registration with no message either.

So a report is built from both halves — the captured diagnostics and a
structural comparison of the two documents — and ``altered`` is empty only
when every check ran and every check found nothing. A check that could not run
leaves a row carrying ``undetermined``, which no caller can read as clean.
Producer text that matches no known shape is carried verbatim rather than
dropped, so a producer upgrade that rewords a message degrades to "here is
what it said" instead of to silence.
