"""Write a PDF's text layer to a plain-text file.

Two orderings, because a page's reading sequence and its visual layout answer
different questions. pdfminer's default analysis flows text boxes into one
reading order; disabling `boxes_flow` orders them by position alone, which is
what a column-preserving transcription needs.

A page break is written as a form feed (U+000C), the separator text extractors
use, so a page-scoped transcription can be split back into pages.
