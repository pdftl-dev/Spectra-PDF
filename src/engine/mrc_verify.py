"""The MRC text-verification gate.

A compression setting is allowed to be lossy. It is NOT allowed to quietly
destroy the text the user came for — and MRC's failure mode when it goes wrong
is exactly that: the stencil is where every glyph lives, so a segmentation that
misjudges a page does not produce a visibly broken document, it produces a
plausible-looking one whose words have changed. `mrc_verify_text` is the switch
that refuses to ship such a page.

Three things here were decided rather than assumed, and each is the reason the
obvious shape would have been wrong:

1. **The comparison is made against the LAYERS THAT WERE ENCODED, not against
   an idealised composite.** `reconstruct_page` decodes the very `bg`/`fg`
   bytes about to be embedded and composites them through the very stencil
   that was verified — so JPEG blocking, JPEG 2000 quantization and the
   downsample/upsample round trip are all inside the measurement. A
   reconstruction built from the pre-encode arrays would grade a page on
   quality it is not going to ship.

2. **The revert happens BEFORE the surgery, never after it.** The pass builds
   the layers, reconstructs, recognises, compares — and only then rewrites the
   page. A page that fails is a page nothing was done to: there is no undo
   path to get wrong, and the output carries the ORIGINAL scan for that page.

3. **`SequenceMatcher` is used with `autojunk=False` over a normalised word
   list, and never positionally** (rule 4). The autojunk heuristic
   discards any token appearing in more than 1% of a sequence longer than 200
   — on a page of prose that is most words — and it scores a CORRECT page at
   7/713. A positional `zip` misaligns completely after one
   inserted word.
