"""Digital signatures: verification AND signing.

Verification (``verify_signatures``) reports, per embedded signature: whether
it's cryptographically valid, whether the bytes it covers are intact, whether
the document was modified after signing (coverage level), the signer's
certificate identity, and the claimed signing time.

Verification scope — deliberately "single-cert": we validate
the signature's cryptography and the document's integrity, but do NOT
validate the signer's certificate against any trust store, nor check
revocation, nor timestamp/LTV. So ``trusted`` is reported but is
DETERMINISTICALLY False — the UI must present a valid result as
"cryptographically valid, signer identity NOT verified against a trusted
authority", never as fully trusted. PAdES/LTV/TSA are not implemented; an
arm's-length AGPL subprocess is the documented integration path.

Signing (``sign_pdf``) is shipped:
signer sources are a .pfx/.p12 (``_load_signer_from_pfx``), a PEM key +
certificate pair with key-match validation (``_load_signer_from_pem``), a
PKCS#11 token, or a certificate in the Windows certificate store whose key
never leaves the platform (``StoreSigner`` over ``engine.wincert``);
placement is invisible, a visible stamp rect, or an existing empty signature
field (``--existing-field`` / sign-into-field); ``generate_signer`` creates
an in-app self-signed identity.

CRITICAL — trust context: we pass an EXPLICIT EMPTY trust context
(``ValidationContext(trust_roots=[])``), NOT ``signer_validation_context=None``.
Passing None does NOT mean "no anchor": pyHanko's SimpleTrustManager.build
treats ``trust_roots is None`` as "load the operating system's certificate
store" (oscrypto `trust_list.get_list()` — ~dozens of real CA roots on
Windows). Under None, a PDF signed by any commercial CA would come back
``trusted=True``, machine-dependent, silently contradicting the explicit-trust
promise. An explicit empty ``trust_roots=[]`` (a non-None value, so no OS
fallback) makes ``trusted`` deterministically False regardless of the host's
trust store. Regression-tested by monkeypatching the OS store to contain the
signer cert and asserting ``trusted`` stays False.

The OS store IS reachable, but only as an explicit opt-in (``system_trust``),
never as a fallback: it goes through ``engine.os_trust``, which respects the
store's per-purpose (EKU) restrictions and is not read at all while the option
is off. The bundled EU trusted-list certificates (``engine.eutl``) are a third
source on the same terms — opt-in per source (``eutl_trust``), off by default,
never read while off, and offline: the bundle ships, nothing fetches it. The
bundled platform root-program certificates (``engine.msctl``) are a fourth on
exactly those terms (``msctl_trust``). Which anchor set a chain reached is
reported per signature as ``trust_source``.

Uses pyHanko (MIT) — the ByteRange / CMS / incremental-update handling is
exactly the security-critical plumbing not to hand-roll.

    revision). ``output`` may be a new file OR the
    same path as ``file`` (in-place signing — the append is byte-safe over
    the original, and the write is atomic).

    Signer source: EXACTLY ONE of a PKCS#12 file (``pfx_path``), a PEM/DER
    key + certificate pair (``key_path`` + ``cert_path``; ``cert_path`` may be
    a fullchain file), a PKCS#11 token (``pkcs11_module`` +
    ``pkcs11_token`` + ``pkcs11_cert_label``, optional ``pkcs11_key_label``
    defaulting to the cert label, ``pkcs11_pin``), or a certificate in the
    Windows certificate store named by its SHA-1 thumbprint (``store_cert``,
    ``store_machine`` to read the machine store instead of the user's), or a
    credential at a remote signing service (``csc_url`` + ``csc_credential``,
    with the user's own OAuth registration in ``csc_client_id`` /
    ``csc_client_secret``; ``csc_grant`` names which grant that registration
    uses, and the authorization-code grant additionally carries ``csc_code`` /
    ``csc_redirect_uri`` / ``csc_verifier`` from the sign-in the user just
    completed in their browser). ``csc_headless`` marks a run with nobody
    present, where a browser sign-in is refused by name rather than attempted.
    Neither the store source nor the signing service takes a secret from us at
    all: Windows collects any PIN or consent itself, inside the sign call, and
    the signing service's own sign-in collects the remote one — this
    application never accepts a PIN or one-time password for either, and the
    document's bytes never leave the machine for a remote signature, only its
    digest. ``password`` unlocks the
    file-based sources (empty string for an unencrypted PEM key); the PIN
    unlocks the token, and like the password it is NEVER placed in results,
    errors, or logs. Every signing feature below — visible stamps,
    existing-field fill, in-place, PAdES/TSA/LTV/LTA — works identically
    with a token signer; the session stays open only for the signing step.

    Appearance: by default the signature is INVISIBLE. Passing ``appearance``
    = ``{page: <1-based>, rect: [x0,y0,x1,y1]}`` (PDF user-space points,
    bottom-up — the same convention as redaction regions) draws a visible
    stamp (signer, signing time, optional reason/location) at that box in a
    NEW signature field.

    Existing field: passing ``existing_field`` instead FILLS the
    named, already-present, EMPTY signature field — the field's own widget
    /Rect provides the stamp box (a zero-size widget signs invisibly, which
    is that field's design). Mutually exclusive with ``appearance`` (each
    decides the placement); refuses (before any signing work) when the field
    is missing, not a signature field, or already signed.

    SECURITY: the ``password`` is used only to load the signer and is NEVER
    placed in the return value, an error message, or any log. The result is
    self-verified via verify_signatures so the caller gets immediate
    confirmation.

    Args:
        file: Input PDF path.
        output: Output path for the signed PDF; may equal ``file`` (in place).
        pfx_path: PKCS#12 (.pfx/.p12) signer file.
        password: Passphrase for the signer (empty string if none).
        field_name: NEW signature field name (default "Signature1"); ignored
            when ``existing_field`` is given.
        reason / location: Optional signature metadata (not secret).
        key_path / cert_path: PEM/DER signer files (alternative to pfx_path).
        store_cert: SHA-1 thumbprint of a certificate in the Windows
            certificate store. Its private key stays inside the platform —
            only the signed-attributes digest crosses to it.
        store_machine: read the machine store rather than the user's.
        appearance: Optional visible-stamp placement (see above).
        existing_field: Name of an existing empty signature field to fill.
        trust_roots: CA certificate files anchoring the signer's own chain
            while revocation material is gathered for the DSS.
        system_trust: also anchor that gathering on the operating system's
            certificate store. Off by default, read only when True.
        eutl_trust: also anchor that gathering on the bundled EU trusted-list
            certificates. Off by default, read only when True.
        msctl_trust: also anchor that gathering on the bundled platform
            root-program certificates. Off by default, read only when True.
        certify: Apply an AUTHOR (certification) signature, which records in
            the catalog what may change in the document afterwards. At most one
            per document, and it must be the document's first signature.
        certify_level: What the certification permits — ``"none"`` (no changes)
            / ``"form-fill"`` (form filling and signing) / ``"annotate"`` (form
            filling, signing and commenting), defaulting to ``"form-fill"``.
            Refuses without ``certify``: the level applies to approval
            signatures too under PDF 2.0, and writing one there produces an
            entry most readers disregard.
        lock: Which form fields this signature locks — ``"all"`` /
            ``"include"`` (only those named) / ``"exclude"`` (all but those
            named). Independent of ``certify``: a lock binds with no
            certification present, and one signature can carry both.
        lock_fields: The field names the two list actions name. Fully qualified;
            a name that scopes a subtree locks everything beneath it.
        stamp_style: What the visible stamp LOOKS like — which text lines it
            renders, a logo/background raster and whether the text sits over
            or beside it, and a personal-signature face. See
            `stamp_appearance.parse_appearance` for the full specification.
            Ignored by an invisible signature, which draws nothing; it travels
            every other placement, including the incremental append onto an
            already-signed document. Omitted, the stamp is the plain signer +
            timestamp one.
        font_dir: The app's bundled fonts directory, which is where a typed
            personal-signature face is resolved from. Never a system font.
