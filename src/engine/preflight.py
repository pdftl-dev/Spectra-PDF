"""Preflight — 38 print-production checks across seven categories.

A preflight verdict is meaningless without the rule it was measured against,
so the profile is not a filter over a fixed report: it IS the report's premise.
Every check row carries the parameters it resolved to, which is what makes the
artifact legible a year later by someone who does not have the profile.

Four rules govern the whole inventory, and each one is a bug if dropped.

**Five verdicts, and `pass` is never the fallback.** ``not_applicable`` is a
state of its own, and it carries two different sentences: a document with no
images has nothing to say about image resolution, and a profile that DISABLED
the image checks said so on purpose. Neither is a pass, and both are excluded
from the pass tally.

**Severity is the profile's; the verdict is the document's.** A check decides
clean or dirty; the profile decides whether dirty reads as `fail` or `warn`.
One implementation, nine shipped opinions.

**A check that can be wrong reports ``needs_review``, never ``fail``.** A false
failure on a conforming press file costs a print run. Total area coverage
beyond its stated budget, an overprint over ink no resolver could evaluate, a
resolution figure standing over unmeasurable placements — each is reported
with its inventory so a human reviews a list rather than a document.

**"Could not look" is never "nothing found".** A resource branch that will not
read names what it could have been hiding, and every check whose fact is in
that set degrades to ``needs_review``. A positive finding is still certain: a
non-embedded font found is a non-embedded font, so `warn` and `fail` stand
whatever else the walk could not reach.

Addresses come in three kinds, each matching a jump the app already performs:
``page`` (a box, a size or a coverage figure is about a page, not a thing on
it), ``content`` ({page, rect}) and ``object`` ({page, annotation} · {field} ·
{ink}). An address never outlives the report it was read from, so the report
re-runs on every buffer change.

    Page `/Resources` and nested Form XObjects, plus `/Pattern` (a tiling
    pattern's own resources, a shading pattern's shading), `/Shading`, image
    `/ColorSpace`, and annotation appearance streams. A colorant reached only
    through a pattern or an image is still a colorant on the plate, so the
    walk must reach all of them.

    `on_colorspace(cs, category)` and `on_font(font, category)` carry the
    route the resource was reached by — one of `content`, `image`, `shading`,
    `pattern`, `annotation`. "RGB is present" and "an IMAGE is RGB" are
    different checks in every commercial profile, and a Type 3 font inside an
    appearance stream is not page content; the category is what tells each
    pair apart.

    `on_stream(obj, category)` hands over each content stream — the page's
    own, every form XObject and tiling pattern, every annotation appearance.
    A device colour set by a `g`/`rg`/`k` operator names no resource at all,
    so a caller asking which colour families a page carries reads them here;
    the resource callbacks alone would report a page painted entirely in
    `1 0 0 rg` as carrying no colour space.

    `on_extgstate(gs, category)` hands over each graphics state whole. The
    transparency callback answers the alpha question; overprint is a different
    question about the same dictionary, and a second traversal to ask it would
    drift from this one the moment nothing compared them.

    A malformed object skips its branch instead of sinking the walk, and every
    skip is REPORTED through `on_unreadable(facts, reason)`: `facts` names
    what that branch could have been hiding, `reason` says what went wrong.
    A caller that treats a skipped branch as "nothing there" turns "I could
    not look" into a passing check, so the channel is not optional detail —
    it is the other half of every answer this walk gives.

    WHAT THIS CHECK REPORTS, AND WHERE IT STOPS. The standard is not held in
    this repository (`engine/processing_steps.py` records the gap and names
    the corroborating source), so the check makes no conformance claim. It
    answers three questions off the document's own declarations:

      * whether the document declares processing steps at all;
      * whether a declared step is PRINTING — neither hidden in the default
        configuration nor declared off the print by its usage entry, so the
        die line or the varnish reaches the device with the artwork. This is
        the silent-wrongness case that costs a plate, and it is decidable
        from the file alone. It is reported only where a profile asks for it:
        the whole GWG corpus leaves its steps printing in this sense and the
        whole GWG corpus is compliant, so the shipped default asks the
        question and does not answer it as a defect;
      * whether a declaration is structurally wrong in a way that needs no
        vocabulary to see: no group named at all, or a type written on a
        group that defines none.

    A group or type OUTSIDE the known vocabulary reports `needs_review`, not
    a failure. The vocabulary here is second-hand and the published
    reproductions of it disagree on their own length; failing a conforming
    packaging file over a type this repository has merely never heard of
    would cost a print run to save a lookup.

    THE CASE THIS CHECK CANNOT SEE, stated so nobody reads its silence as an
    all-clear: content that IS a die line or a varnish but sits on an
    ordinary artwork layer with nothing declaring it. There is no declaration
    to read, and deciding it from geometry — a thin closed path near the trim
    is a die line, or is a border — needs the standard's own criteria and
    would guess without them. Undeclared processing-step content is out of
    scope for a mechanical verdict and is not reported as absent.
