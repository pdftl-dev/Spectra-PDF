"""Per-run text measurement — the ONE geometry authority for the content
walkers.

Until this module existed there were TWO answers to "how wide is this show
operator": `text_runs.py` decoded the run through its font and summed the real
advances (+ TJ kern, Tc, Tw, Tz), while `redact.py` guessed a flat 0.5 em per
BYTE. The guess was a **redaction false negative** — measured against the
shipped engine, one 45-character line at 11 pt:

    Courier         real 297.0 pt   estimate 247.5 pt   est/real 0.83
    Helvetica-Bold  real 263.5      estimate 247.5      est/real 0.94
    Helvetica       real 255.6      estimate 247.5      est/real 0.97
    a 2-byte CID font                                   est/real 2.00

so on every monospace document the last sixth of each line sat OUTSIDE the
bbox redaction tested against: a mark drawn on that text reported
`regions_applied: 1, text_runs_removed: 0` and the words stayed extractable.
The CID direction is the mirror — a mark 10 pt clear of a CJK run deleted it.

The fix is a deletion, not an invention: the real computation already lived in
the lister's walk with the same `GraphicsTextState`. It moved here so both
walkers call it, and `AVG_CHAR_ADVANCE_EM` is gone.

Two things a security walker needs that a lister does not, and they are the
reason this module has a surface of its own:

  - **`FontCapability.measures()`** — whether the advances are DECLARED or
    defaulted. A width that falls back to the 500/1000 placeholder is a guess,
    and a guess that comes out narrow is the same false negative in a new
    costume. An unmeasurable run gets `wide_width()` instead: 1 em per CODE,
    which over-covers every real face (over-removal is the tolerable error for
    a redaction tool; under-removal is not).
  - **`ink_extent_em()`** — the run's VERTICAL extent from the font's own
    descriptor. The lister's rect is baseline → baseline + font size, which is
    the right box to CLICK but the wrong box to test ink against: measured at
    12 pt Helvetica it misses 2.48 pt of descender below the baseline (`p`,
    `g`, `y`, `j`, `q`) and adds 2.48 pt of empty leading above. A band drawn
    across the descenders of a line missed the bbox entirely.
