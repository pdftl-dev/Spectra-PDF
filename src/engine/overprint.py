"""Overprint — the graphics-state flag nothing in this app read.

`/ExtGState /OP`, `/op` and `/OPM` decide whether a paint knocks out what is
under it or lays down on top of it. The only occurrence of those keys anywhere
else in the engine WRITES one, for the colour bar's own control patch; nothing
reported them, so an overprinting white headline — a real and expensive press
defect — passed preflight silently.

**A verdict here is only ever as certain as the ink.** "White text set to
overprint" is determinate exactly where the ink is provably zero-tint in a
space that resolved: a tint of 0 in a `/Separation` is white, a `/DeviceN` at
0 across its components is white, `0 0 0 0 k` is white — and an ICC, indexed
or otherwise unresolvable value is NOT knowable. Reporting one of those as
white would fail a design that is correct, so `zero_tint` is a third state and
the caller reports `needs_review` for it rather than `fail`.

The walk is this module's own and it is small: no CTM, no text matrix, no
glyph metrics. It tracks the graphics-state stack, the colour in force and the
paint operators, because that is the whole question. It is NOT a second copy
of `sanitize_content`'s analysis walk — that walk emits a paint event only
where the paint can serve as a BACKDROP (opaque, axis-aligned), which is the
wrong filter here: an overprinting white headline is precisely the paint it
discards.

A form XObject is walked with its own resources; a stream that will not parse
is reported through `unreadable` and never counted as clean.
