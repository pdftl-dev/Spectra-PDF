"""Bookmarks derived from a document's own structure tree.

`autotag` CREATES a structure tree and `set_outline` WRITES a bookmark tree;
this module is the join between them. A tagged document's headings ARE its
outline — the title is the heading's own text and the destination is where the
heading sits — so typing them by hand is transcription, not authoring.

Three rules earned here:

1. **Level comes from the tag, except for the generic `H`, whose level comes
   from NESTING.** The spec gives `H` no level of its own: a heading inside two
   enclosing grouping elements is a level-3 heading. Every other heading tag
   (`H1`…`H6`) names its level, and `/RoleMap` indirection is resolved first so
   a document that spells its headings with private tag names still works.

2. **The title is resolved through a stated ladder, and a heading that
   defeats all of it is REPORTED rather than written as "Untitled".**
   `/ActualText`, then `/Alt`, then the text of the marked content the element
   references, then `/T`. A bookmark whose title is a placeholder is worse than
   a stated shortfall: the user cannot tell it apart from a real one.

3. **The destination carries the heading's POSITION, not just its page.** The
   runs carrying the heading's MCID give a rect, and the bookmark lands as
   `/XYZ left top` at its top-left corner. Jumping to "the page the heading is
   on" puts a mid-page heading off-screen, which is the thing a derived
   outline exists to avoid.

MCID → text is the machinery none of this had. It rides `text_runs._walk_runs`,
which now reports each run's innermost marked-content id from the SAME walk
that produced the run — parallel walks disagreeing about content is the class
`search_regions` documents at length. MCIDs are scoped to a content stream, so
a run inside a form XObject is not in the page's numbering and is not offered
as a source; such a heading falls through the ladder instead.
