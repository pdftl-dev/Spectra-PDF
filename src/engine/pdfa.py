    """Convert a PDF to PDF/A format using Ghostscript.

    **The conversion reaches conformance partly by deleting content, so the
    result reports what it cost.** ``altered`` carries one row per loss —
    annotations, form fields, attachments, document scripts, optional content,
    tags, a page whose text became a picture, a substituted font — and is
    empty only when every check ran and found nothing; a check that could not
    run leaves a row marked ``undetermined``. ``producer_notices`` carries
    Ghostscript text that matched no known shape, verbatim.

    ``declared_conformance`` is what the OUTPUT FILE asserts about itself,
    read back out of its own metadata. It is not a validation: Ghostscript is
    a producer, and no validator runs here. A conversion whose output does not
    declare the requested level refuses and removes what it wrote, because the
    one thing this op must never do is leave a file whose formal, machine-
    readable claim outlives every chance to correct it.

    Encryption does NOT survive this conversion, and must not: ISO 19005
    forbids a PDF/A file from being encrypted, so an encrypted source cannot
    have a conformant encrypted output. The drop is reported like every other
    one, as an ``encryption_removed`` row.

    Interactive form fields do NOT survive this conversion (gs pdfwrite drops
    them) — and unlike compress/grayscale, they are deliberately NOT
    reattached here: our field appearance streams reference unembedded
    fonts, which PDF/A forbids, so reattaching would silently break the very
    conformance this op exists to produce. Archival conversion of a form is
    flatten-then-convert, and the drop is now reported rather than only
    documented.
