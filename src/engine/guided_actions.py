"""Guided-actions folder runs — the Action Wizard's batch half.

Runs a validated step sequence over every PDF under a source folder,
mirroring the tree into a destination (the batch-OCR shape: sources are
never modified, outputs land at the same relative paths, one file's failure
never stops the run). Lives ENGINE-SIDE deliberately: one RPC per run, the
CLI arm gets it for free, and a scheduled run can fire with the app closed —
the same reasoning that put batch OCR here.

Steps arrive as DATA (saved actions, CLI JSON, scheduled profiles), so they
are validated against an explicit dispatch table — op names and parameter
keys both — never splatted blindly into calls. Tool paths (Ghostscript,
Tesseract, the font dir) are injected per-op from the run's own arguments.

Each file is copied to its mirror path first and the steps run IN-PLACE on
the copy — the engine-wide in-place support (engine/inplace.py) makes every
step atomic per write, and a failed step deletes the partial copy so the
mirror never holds half-processed files.

**One step breaks that shape deliberately: `create_pdf`.** It
PRODUCES the mirrored document instead of transforming a copy of the source,
so an action can start "convert every Office file that lands in this folder"
and then compress, stamp and OCR the result. Because it produces rather than
transforms it is only valid FIRST (`validate_steps` refuses it anywhere else,
by name), it is incompatible with in-place mode, and its presence widens what
the run walks from PDFs to the whole Create PDF accepted set.
