"""Paragraph grouping + reflow (the last content-editing slice).

Groups the text runs of a page into PARAGRAPH BOXES — the industry
editor's model — and re-lays-out a paragraph's text inside its box on
edit (rewrap at the measured width, alignment/indent/leading preserved,
growth downward). The one-line summary of every structural rule:

  - Grouping happens HERE (engine), from the SAME `_walk_runs` walk that
    produces the run listing — index agreement by construction. Lines never
    mix streams, but a paragraph MAY continue across a stream boundary
    (page → form, form → form) under strict evidence: the same geometric
    join tests, plus z-order adjacency — no visible foreign run between the
    fragments in content order (the false-positive direction is the
    dangerous one). An apply then runs ONE per-stream rewrite per involved
    stream — each member's replacement text lands in ITS stream, form-hosted
    members via copy-on-write of the whole Do chain, one atomic save.
  - Only axis-aligned runs under a SHARED linear matrix group; rotated /
    skewed text simply never forms a paragraph and stays on the
    run-box surface. Refused paragraphs (uneditable member, RTL) are
    LISTED with their reason and decompose to run boxes in the renderer.
  - Line assembly: baseline clustering, superscript attach (near-baseline
    offsets become rise-carrying spans), column split at large gaps.
    Paragraph assembly: leading consistency, horizontal overlap,
    dominant-size continuity, bullet-line breaks.
  - Logical text: run texts in line order; synthetic U+0020 at positioned
    word gaps (between runs AND inside TJ arrays); lines join with a
    space except after a line-terminal hyphen (hyphens are document text
    — never de-/re-hyphenated).
  - The heuristic THRESHOLDS below are code constants pinned by the
    fixture matrix (tests own the numbers, the doc owns the intent).
  - Vertical runs ride the SAME pipeline under one 90°
    transposition T(x, y) = (−y, x), applied at exactly TWO boundaries:
    member admission (`_members_from` — a column IS a line, the column
    pitch IS the leading, top-alignment IS left-alignment) and the
    emission's per-segment Tm anchor (T⁻¹(x', y') = (y', −x'); the
    linear part is untouched — glyphs stay upright, the walker's
    vertical advance model owns the direction). Every grouping heuristic
    between the boundaries applies unchanged. Modes never mix: the
    writing mode rides INSIDE lkey, which also makes the merge's
    lkey guard refuse cross-mode merges for free.

The rewrite half (`replace_paragraph_text`) lives here too: member show
ops are removed, the paragraph re-emitted at the first member's position
as absolutely-positioned lines, and every kept op after the divergence is
resynced (position AND text state) against a parallel walk of the
ORIGINAL stream — see `_ResyncEmitter`. The correctness property (every
kept show renders at an identical matrix with identical state) is
asserted directly by the test suite's dual-walk harness.

    #   - no substitution/feature request and no per-span face — asking

    #     id IS the code) and the program-side one (cmap + GSUB still
    #     present) both hold — `in_place_face` checks them;
    #   - every joining word of the NEW text shapes without `.notdef`
    #     (a subset keeps only the glyphs it drew, and a form the new
    #     text needs may be gone);

    #     gets exactly one ToUnicode entry — a shaped cluster that wants
    #     gid G to spell Y when the document already has it spelling X
    #     cannot be expressed, and the fatha-as-sukun lesson says

    """Replace a paragraph's text and re-lay-out inside its box.

    `spans` is the renderer-computed style mapping (char range → member
    run); `expected_runs`/`expected_text` are the fingerprint — grouping
    is a heuristic, so the apply re-derives it and REFUSES on mismatch
    rather than ever silently retargeting. `convert=True` renders
    characters the mapped font cannot express in the bundled fallback
    font (`font_path`), the machinery shared at span granularity.

    restyle: `size` (points) applies a uniform new font size to the
    whole paragraph (scaling leading + rewrapping); `color` is an
    [r, g, b] triple (0-1) applied as a uniform fill colour. Either None
    keeps the paragraph's own.

    restyle: `family` ("serif" | "sans" | "mono") and/or
    `bold`/`italic` (absolute booleans — a present value states the
    substituted face's weight/slant outright) substitute the WHOLE
    paragraph into the matching bundled Liberation face — every
    character re-embeds via the fallback machinery (`font_path`
    required), an honest substitution of the original foundry font.
    Family defaults to the first member's own classification when
    only a style is given, so bold-only on a serif paragraph lands
    LiberationSerif-Bold. Characters the Liberation face lacks refuse
    with a stated reason. All three None keeps the paragraph's own
    fonts (the unstyled path, byte-identical).

    split: `split_at` (a code-point offset strictly inside
    `new_text`) lays the text out as TWO blocks, the second starting
    2×leading below the first — a gap the re-listing grouping can never
    join across, so the result lists as two paragraphs. None = the
    shipped single-block layout (byte-identical).

    Split gap: `split_gap` (leading multiples, [1.3, 10]) scales the
    gap between the two blocks; the 2×eff relist floor never shrinks, so
    every allowed factor still lists as two paragraphs. Requires
    `split_at`; None = the shipped 2.0.

    resize: `box_width` (points, paragraph space) rewraps the
    paragraph to an explicit measure — first-line indent preserved,
    center/right/justify positioned against the new edges, and a width no
    word can wrap into REFUSES rather than overflowing the box the user
    drew. `box_left` (requires `box_width`) additionally moves the left
    edge — the renderer sends it when the LEFT handle dragged. Both None
    = the shipped derived measures, byte-identical.

    Per-span styling: `span_styles` is None or a list of
    `{start, end, color?: [r, g, b], family?, bold?, italic?, size?}` over
    CODE-POINT ranges of `new_text` (distinct from the style-SOURCE
    `spans`; sparse; need not align to span boundaries; overlaps fold
    last-wins). A `color` recolours its range, overriding the
    whole-paragraph `color` (metric-neutral). A `family`/`bold`/
    `italic` SUBSTITUTES its range into the matching bundled Liberation
    face — one embedded subset per distinct requested face, family
    absent = keep the char's member family, the same honest substitution
    Does whole-paragraph. A `size` (points, clamped [1, 1638]) resizes
    just its range, overriding the whole-paragraph `size` — the
    range's Tf grows/shrinks, its width and wrap follow, and the LINE it
    lands on gets tallest-glyph leading while other lines keep theirs. The
    colour, face, and size axes fold INDEPENDENTLY (a range can be red AND
    bold AND bigger, on unaligned ranges). Per-span faces inherit the substitution's
    refusals (a char the Liberation face lacks is named); vertical
    paragraphs refuse substitution. None throughout = byte-identical
    shipped.

    Vertical paragraphs reflow through the same pipeline in
    transposed space (columns fill top-down at the measured pitch, growth
    adds columns leftward; size scales the pitch, split gaps transpose).
    Family/bold/italic substitution and per-char convert refuse — the
    fallback faces are horizontal (v1 boundary)."""
