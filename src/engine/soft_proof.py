"""The soft proof: plate coverage back through a press profile.

`separations.composite_separations` multiplies each ink's display colour
down. That is an ink preview and it is not colour management: 100 % of each
of Cyan, Magenta and Yellow multiplies to (0, 0, 0), where a press profile
puts the same overprint near (68, 68, 70). This module supplies the managed
alternative — the plate coverages become a CMYK accumulation buffer and one
LittleCMS transform takes that buffer to sRGB.

Four profile sources, in precedence order: the document's own
`/OutputIntents` `/DestOutputProfile`, a user-picked `.icc`, a bundled press
profile named by its ICC description string, and none. None is the multiply
model, byte for byte — and it is the only source that means "no proof". A
bundled press this engine cannot produce REFUSES BY NAME; it never resolves
to the same record as none.

Two switches, one intent and one flag. Simulating paper white is
ABSOLUTE_COLORIMETRIC — the media white point is held rather than mapped
onto the display's, so unpainted paper renders as the dim tone the profile
says it is. Simulating black ink CLEARS black-point compensation, so the
darkest ink the press can lay down arrives at its own value instead of at
display black. **Under absolute colorimetric the flag changes nothing on any
patch**: the intent already carries both endpoints of the medium, so there
is no black point left to compensate. A request for absolute WITH
compensation is therefore normalized to absolute without it, and the
returned record reports the normalized pair rather than the request.

Every refusal here is REPORTED rather than raised. A proof that cannot be
produced falls back to the multiply composite with the reason carried beside
it in the same return, so a request the engine did not honour can never look
honoured.

The separation device ignores the destination profile — plates are
byte-identical across profiles — so a page carrying colour that is not
already device CMYK must be colour-managed to the profile BEFORE it is
separated, or the ink amounts on the plates come from the conversion's own
default destination rather than from the press being proofed.
`staging_applies` is that test, and it reads the colour families the ink
inventory's own walk reached.
