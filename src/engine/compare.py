"""Comparison between two PDFs: text diff and visual (pixel) diff.

Text: extracts text per page (pdfminer, the same path as extract_text), then
diffs the two documents' line lists with Python's stdlib ``difflib`` — no new
dependency, and the text already lives on the Python side. Output is a
unified-diff-style row list (context / add / remove / gap) with each row
attributed to its source page, plus a summary (similarity, counts, page
counts). Rows from similar replaced-line pairs additionally carry word-level
``segments`` for intra-line highlighting. Read-only: neither file is modified.

Visual: rasterizes both files with the configured Ghostscript (``ppmraw`` — PPM
P6 is a trivial stdlib parse: header + raw RGB bytes, no PIL/numpy/PNG
dependency) and pixel-diffs page pairs 1:1 by index, reporting per-pair diff
counts and changed-region rectangles in PDF points. Engine-side deliberately —
GUI and CLI share one implementation (parity invariant), and it works for
scanned/image PDFs that the text diff cannot see. Both documents render with
the same gs build and settings in the same run, so identical content produces
identical bytes and the default tolerance is 0.

Deliberately stdlib difflib rather than a `diff-match-patch` / `similar`
dependency, and deliberately Ghostscript-side rather than renderer-side
`pixelmatch`.

    HALTS at the same node (silently, rc 0). For mid-tree damage the two
    therefore disagree (detector fires) — but for TAIL damage, where nothing
    real follows the break, "skip and continue" and "stop dead" land on the
