"""Autotag — build a structure tree for an UNTAGGED PDF heuristically.

The Tags panel deliberately refuses to conjure a tree from nothing (an empty
manual tree helps no one); this op is the content-analysis half that makes a
first tree, which the panel and the Reading Order panel can then refine.

The heuristic works at the CONTENT-STREAM level, page by page:
  - every top-level BT..ET text block becomes one structure element, its
    role decided by the block's largest font size against the document's
    body size (>= 1.6x -> H1, >= 1.25x -> H2, else P);
  - a block SMALLER than the body size sitting wholly inside the page's top
    or bottom margin is a running head or a folio, and becomes an Artifact —
    a positive statement that the content is decoration, which is what keeps
    it out of a read-aloud. Both conditions are required: a title sits in the
    top margin too, and it is bigger than the body, not smaller;
  - every image XObject `Do` becomes a Figure;
  - the operators are wrapped in `/Role <</MCID n>> BDC ... EMC` marked
    content, elements reference the MCIDs, the page gets /StructParents and
    the root a matching /ParentTree — the full tagged-PDF wiring, so the
    result survives commits (struct-carry) and reads back through pdf.js.

Reading order is STREAM order by design: it is what an untagged file
actually has, and the Reading Order panel exists to fix it afterwards.

The body size is the size the document sets most of its TEXT in, weighted by
how many characters each block shows rather than by how many blocks there are.
A block count makes every block equal, so a page of one long paragraph, one
heading and one folio has a three-way tie — and a tie broken toward the
smallest size elects the folio as the body, which turns the actual body copy
into a heading. Characters are what "most of the document" means.

Honest limits (documented, not silent): font size is the raw `Tf` operand and
block position is the raw text-matrix translation (neither composes the CTM),
Form-XObject interiors are not descended into, and an ALREADY-TAGGED file is
refused — retagging is the Tags panel's judgment call, not a batch
heuristic's. Autotag names no figure: `/Alt` cannot be invented, and a figure
with placeholder alternate text is worse than one the checker reports.
