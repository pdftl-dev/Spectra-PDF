"""Query → GLYPH-ACCURATE page regions.

`search_in_files` answers "which pages match"; the in-app index answers the
same question faster. Neither returns a RECTANGLE, and a redaction tool that
cannot say WHERE a hit is cannot mark it. This module is the door that can.

**The rect authority is the engine's own run walk, sliced per CODE**, measured
exact: against pdfminer's own per-character geometry, the computed rect of
`"John Smith"` inside a 41-character Helvetica run came out

    computed  [72.0, 700.0, 132.02, 712.0]
    pdfminer  [72.0, 697.52, 132.02, 709.52]     dx0 +0.00  dx1 +0.00 pt

— horizontally exact to the hundredth of a point, and vertically off by
exactly the difference between an EM box and an INK box. The search worker has
no geometry at all, and a pdf.js text item carries one width for the whole
item with no per-character breakdown, so interpolating inside it is wrong for
every proportional font. "Approximately right" is not a thing a redaction rect
may be, so neither of those is the authority.

Five rules:

1. **The match runs on THIS walk's own concatenation of the page's runs**, so
   a match offset maps back to (run, code index) by construction. Matching in
   the renderer and geometrising here would need the two to agree about the
   page's text down to the character, and they do not — pdfminer's layout
   order, pdf.js's item order and the stream's own order all differ.
2. **The rect is the per-code slice, adjusted to the font's INK extent** —
   `text_metrics.ink_extent_em`, the same descent/ascent redaction's own bbox
   uses. A run rect drawn baseline → baseline + size leaves the
   descenders of `p g y j q` visible under the black box.
3. **A hit spanning several runs yields ONE RECT PER RUN**, never a bounding
   box across them: a phrase broken over a line wrap would otherwise cover the
   right margin, the left margin and everything between.
4. **Rotation and nested forms fall out of the walk** — `_walk_runs` composes
   `tm ∘ ctm` and recurses into form XObjects with the form matrix, so the
   rect is already in page space. A run clipped entirely away is invisible and
   is not offered as a hit.
5. **Vertical runs are honoured, not excluded** — the lister emits a
   vertical run's column rect and the per-code slice is a vertical slice.
   Refusing CJK vertical text would be a whole document class that cannot be
   redacted.

A run whose font cannot MEASURE (the `measurable()`) still produces a
hit: its FULL rect, flagged `imprecise`, over-covering rather than guessing a
slice — never a dropped hit, because a hit the tool does not report is content
the user does not redact.
