"""Author new AcroForm fields into a document, by path.

The interactive canvas tier authors fields renderer-side; this is the twin the
folder and headless tiers need, in the same relationship form FILL already has
between ``lib/forms.ts`` and ``fill_form_fields``. Both halves are pinned
against a shared spec corpus, because two implementations of one rule drift the
moment nothing compares them.

A spec is the shape the renderer already speaks::

    {"name", "type", "page_index" (0-based), "rect" [x0,y0,x1,y1],
     "options": [str | {"label", "rect"}], "multiline", "comb", "max_length",
     "lock": {"action", "fields"},
     "format": {"kind", ...}, "validate": {"min", "max"},
     "calculate": {"op", "fields"} | {"sfn"}, "default_value"}

``lock`` belongs to a signature field alone and is the seed whoever signs that
field later is bound by. Its names are validated against the document AND
against the batch's own new fields: laying out a form and locking the fields
being laid out in the same pass is the ordinary case.

``format``, ``validate`` and ``calculate`` become the field's ``/AA`` scripts
-- the stock ``AF*`` call shapes, written by ``engine.afemit`` so every other
viewer executes what this app authors. A ``calculate`` also puts the field into
``/AcroForm /CO``, ordered by a topological sort over the dependency graph: a
field placed before what it reads computes a stale value everywhere. A cycle
refuses the batch by name, and so does a calculation naming a field neither the
document nor the batch has.

``default_value`` is ``/DV``: what ``reset_form_fields`` restores to.

Validation is fail-closed and PRE-mutation: every problem in the batch is
reported at once, each naming the field it belongs to, and nothing is written
until all of them pass. A batch that aborts half-way leaves a document carrying
the fields created before the throw, which is the state no caller can reason
about.

An XFA document REFUSES. A dynamic form's fields live in the XML, not in
/AcroForm, so writing an AcroForm field into one either does nothing or
destroys the form when a consumer drops the XML.
