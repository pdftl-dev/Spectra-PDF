"""Bind EXISTING page content and annotations into the structure tree.

Every other structure door edits a tree that already covers the content it
names. This one is the opposite case, and the only capability in the
accessibility round that rewrites a content stream: text drawn inside no
marked-content section has **no MCID at all**, so binding it to a tag means
wrapping it in marked content first. That is autotag's per-segment machinery
(`autotag.py` — emit `BDC … EMC`, create the element, extend `/StructParents`
and the `/ParentTree`) aimed at ONE addressed run on a page that may already be
tagged.

Four rules, each of which is a bug if missed:

1. **MCIDs are allocated above the page's existing maximum**, and the page's
   `/StructParents` key is reused when it has one and allocated from
   `/ParentTreeNextKey` when it does not. Re-using an MCID silently retargets
   an existing tag.
2. **`Artifact` writes `/Artifact BMC … EMC` and creates no element.** An
   artifact is a positive statement that content is NOT content, which is
   exactly what `text_runs` reads back.
3. **A run inside a Form XObject is refused BY NAME**, never silently skipped:
   MCIDs are scoped to their content stream, and the same form drawn twice
   cannot carry a page-scoped id.
4. **The annotation half writes both directions** — an `/OBJR` inside the new
   element AND the annotation's `/StructParent` into the `/ParentTree`. One
   without the other is a tree that reads correctly and reverse-maps wrongly.

Run indexes are `list_text_runs`' own: the traversal here walks the page in the
same order and recurses at the same `Do` positions, so the numbering agrees by
construction rather than by a parallel implementation.

New elements are inserted in STREAM ORDER among their siblings rather than
appended, so a paragraph bound here reads where it is drawn instead of at the
end of the document. Reading order beyond that is the Reading Order panel's.
