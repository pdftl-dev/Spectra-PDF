"""Processing steps — the non-printing layers of a packaging or label file.

A packaging PDF carries more than the artwork that reaches a plate. The die
line, the crease pattern, the glue flaps, the braille positions, the varnish
area and the legend block all travel in the same file, each on its own
optional-content group, and each of them is a MANUFACTURING instruction rather
than something a press lays down as ink. A tool that renders them like artwork
puts a die line on a plate; a tool that counts them in total ink reports a
number about a sheet nobody will print.

SOURCING — A RECORDED GAP
=========================

The standard that governs this is **ISO 19593-1** (Graphic technology — Use of
PDF to associate processing steps and content data — Part 1: Processing steps
for packaging and labels). This repository does NOT hold it: it is not in
`pdfa/`, and per the doc-authority rule that makes every claim below
SECOND-HAND. It is recorded as a gap rather than presented as normative.

What this module is sourced from, in order of weight:

  1. The **GWG Processing Steps Test Suite v1.0** (Ghent Workgroup, February
     2025) — 39 test patches built expressly to check an implementation
     against the ISO specification, plus the suite's own documentation stating
     each patch's expected verdict. The suite's files are the closest thing to
     the standard's own text that is available here, because they were
     authored to exercise it. Every structural claim below about HOW a
     processing step is written into a PDF is read off those 39 files and
     paraphrased; nothing here reproduces the suite's prose.
  2. Public secondary descriptions of the standard's group and type
     vocabulary. These disagree with each other on the size of the
     `Structural` type list, which is exactly why `GROUP_TYPES` below is
     treated as a KNOWN-GOOD set and never as a closed one: a type outside it
     is reported as unrecognized for review, never pronounced invalid.

Nothing this module produces may be described as an ISO 19593-1 conformance
verdict. It reports what a document declares and what is structurally wrong
with the declaration; the questions that need the standard's text stay open
and say so.

HOW A PROCESSING STEP IS WRITTEN
================================

Read off the suite's 39 patches, every one of which agrees: the declaration
lives on the OPTIONAL CONTENT GROUP dictionary itself, in a `/GTS_Metadata`
sub-dictionary holding

    /GTS_ProcStepsGroup   a name — the processing step's GROUP (required)
    /GTS_ProcStepsType    a name — the step's TYPE within that group, present
                          only for the groups that define types

An OCG with no `/GTS_Metadata` is ordinary artwork. The corpus's typed groups
appear as `/Structural` with `/Cutting`, `/Punching`, `/Gluing`, `/Bleed`; the
untyped ones as `/White` and `/Legend`, carrying a group and no type at all.

The PDF page-element mechanism (`/Usage` `/PageElement` `/Subtype`) is a
DIFFERENT thing and is not how a processing step is declared: across the whole
corpus the only `/Usage` dictionaries present are Illustrator `/CreatorInfo`
entries. It is read here and reported as `page_element` for information —
some producers do write a step's name there as well — but it never stands in
for `/GTS_Metadata`, because nothing in the corpus supports that reading.

CUSTOM STEPS AND THE SECOND CLASS NAME
======================================

The standard admits vendor-defined groups and types. The suite's patches show
the mechanism as a REGISTERED PREFIX joined to the name by an underscore — its
own custom entries are spelled `GWGS_…`, and the suite documents both halves
of the rule with dedicated patches: a custom step carrying such a prefix is
compliant-but-notable (a warning patch), and a custom step WITHOUT one is an
error patch. So a name outside the known vocabulary splits two ways here:
prefixed is `custom`, unprefixed is `unregistered`.
