"""ICC-managed colour conversion for prepress.

Converts a document's color to DeviceCMYK for print. Ghostscript drives the
conversion through its built-in ICC engine (LittleCMS), and the destination is
ALWAYS a named profile out of the bundled set (`engine/icc_profiles.py`) or a
profile file the caller supplied: an RGB red (`1 0 0 rg`) comes out as CMYK
(`0 0.996 1 0 k`), not a naive component copy, and which press it came out
FOR is a fact the result carries rather than a property of whatever the
producer was built with.

``convert_cmyk`` takes a destination profile by ICC description string or by
path and reports the description string it used. ``convert_pdfx`` produces a
PDF/X master with a real /OutputIntents entry (GTS_PDFX, the destination
profile embedded as /DestOutputProfile, identified by what the profile itself
declares) via a customized PDFX_def.ps against the bundled template's
contract. Soft-proofing remains a distinct capability.

# ── the colorant-shading carve-out ─────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Ghostscript will not carry a shading it must colour-convert: a `/Separation`
# or `/DeviceN` `sh`, and a shading pattern in one, come back as a DeviceCMYK
# image and the plate is gone — while a DeviceCMYK shading in the same pass
# survives AS a shading (measured). A colorant whose ALTERNATE is already
# DeviceCMYK needs no transform at all, so its shading is staged as its own
# DeviceCMYK equivalent — the alternate space, with the tint transform composed
# onto the shading's function — and the colorant space is put back on the
# object afterwards. Geometry, clip, z-order and coordinate space stay the
# producer's own work, which is why nothing here reconstructs them.
#
# The paints are bracketed in marked content so the staged objects can be found
# again: a bracket survives the rewrite (measured), a resource NAME does not.
# A colorant whose alternate is anything else genuinely needs the transform,
# goes through the producer, and is REPORTED — as is one whose bracket did not
# survive, which costs the plate and never the colour, because the staged
# shading paints exactly what the transform would have painted.
#
# The walk reaches page content, the Form XObjects and tiling patterns under
# it, and annotation APPEARANCE streams: the producer colour-converts an `/AP`
# exactly as it converts page content, so a colorant gradient in one is
# rasterized in the same way (measured). Every appearance is claimed and no
# annotation is exempt, because the producer exempts none:
#   - the FLAGS decide nothing. ISO 32000-2 12.5.3 makes bit 2 (Hidden)
#     suppress both display and print and bit 3 (Print) govern the rest, but
#     the producer converts every appearance whatever they say (measured), so
#     a flag-aware carve-out would leave it free to destroy the plates it
#     skipped. A document's ink inventory is not a rendering question.
#   - every FACE is rewritten — `/N`, `/R`, `/D` and the appearance states.
#   - an annotation the producer DROPS is flattened into the page content it
#     came from (measured), so its bracket travels there and its plate is
#     recovered at the page tier; a subtype the walk skipped would lose that
#     copy to a process raster instead.

    destination profile — the caller's, or the bundled default — is EMBEDDED
    as the intent's /DestOutputProfile and also drives the conversion itself
    (-sOutputICCProfile), so the pixels and the declared condition always
    agree.

    ``condition`` and ``identifier`` are the caller's declaration when the
    caller makes one. Left empty they are READ OFF THE PROFILE
    (`icc_profiles.output_condition`): a profile that declares its own
    characterization identifies the intent by what it declares, and one that
    declares none is identified by its description string with no registry
    named. Nothing here invents a registry name for a profile that carries
    none.

    ``drop_encryption`` is the consent hatch: the conversion runs in a renderer
    subprocess that reads the document and writes a new one, so the source's
    protection cannot ride through. An encrypted source is refused unless the
    user was told that and chose to proceed, and the output then says so as
    ``encryption_removed``.

    Deliberate non-carrier: like PDF/A, the output does NOT get the original's
    interactive form fields transplanted back — a PDF/X master is a print
    exchange file, and conformance limits interactive content (the same
    rationale recorded on the PDF/A converter).

    **The /GTS_PDFXVersion key is written by the preamble above, not earned by
    the conversion, so its presence proves nothing on its own.** Ghostscript
    retreats to ordinary PDF output when it meets content it cannot make
    conformant, and that retreat neither removes the key nor changes the exit
    status — it is stated once, on stderr. So the run is pinned to the policy
    that removes the offending content instead of abandoning the standard, a
    retreat announced anyway is a refusal, and ``altered`` reports what
    reaching conformance cost (see engine/standards_report.py).
