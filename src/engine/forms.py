"""AcroForm read / fill / flatten using pikepdf — WITH appearance generation.

The GUI fill is renderer-side pdf-lib, chosen because filling is really an
appearance-stream problem: a set /V with no regenerated /AP renders blank in
most viewers. This module is the engine-side implementation that gives the
CLI the same behavior as the GUI. The target is pdf-lib's behavior, not
every form variation found in arbitrary PDFs:

- Checkboxes/radios need no appearance generation — their widgets already
  carry every state in /AP /N; filling sets /V to the on-state name and each
  widget's /AS to match. Exact, not approximate.
- Text/dropdown/optionlist regenerate /AP /N per widget from the field's
  effective /DA (font, size, color) against the AcroForm /DR resources.
  Layout (wrap/align/auto-size) uses the shared Helvetica metrics
  (pdf_metrics.py); a non-Helvetica /DA font still RENDERS with the right
  face (the stream references the real /DR font) while layout approximates
  with Helvetica widths — pdf-lib's own default-appearance behavior is
  Helvetica-based, so this matches the parity target.
- /NeedAppearances is set false (real appearances are generated) — pdf-lib's
  posture.
- /XFA SURVIVES a fill on a static XFA form, and the same value lands in
  the datasets packet alongside /V and /AP (ISO 32000-2 Annex K's
  consistency requirement — `engine/xfa` and `engine/xfa_datasets`). A
  dynamic XFA form refuses by name. This is a deliberate divergence from
  pdf-lib, which auto-deletes /XFA on getForm()/save.
- Values with characters outside cp1252 (WinAnsi) fail with a clear error —
  the same class of failure pdf-lib surfaces for its WinAnsi Helvetica.

Fail-closed: every edit is validated BEFORE any mutation (all problems
reported at once); output is written only after the full fill succeeds.
