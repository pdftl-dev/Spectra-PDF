"""Is a usable Ghostscript configured? — the one place that answers.

Ghostscript is a USER-SUPPLIED prerequisite: nothing in the distribution
provides it, so every gs-backed op has to answer "is one there, and does it
work?" before it spawns anything. Answering that by file existence is what
this module exists to stop. A path can name a file that is not a program, a
program that cannot initialise (a copied `gswin64c.exe` without its
`Resource/` tree exits non-zero on the first render while `--version` still
answers), or a build too old for the flags the engine passes. Each of those
reaches the user as a different broken thing when the answer is `os.path
.isfile`, and as one named refusal when the answer is a probe.

The answer is structured — `available`, `path`, `version`, `reason` — because
callers need the REASON, not a boolean: "no Ghostscript is configured" and
"the configured Ghostscript is too old" lead to different actions, and a
refusal that cannot tell them apart sends the user to the wrong control.

Probing costs two subprocess runs, so it is cached per path + mtime + size:
a rebuilt or replaced binary at the same path re-probes, an unchanged one
answers from the cache for the life of the process.

#: The oldest Ghostscript this engine will drive, as (major, minor).
#:
#: The FUNCTIONAL floor is 9.50: `prepress` passes `--permit-file-read=` and
#: `--permit-file-write=` (the destination-profile embed and the ROM-profile
#: extraction cannot work without them), and those options arrived with the
#: 9.50 rework that also made `-dSAFER` the default. An older build rejects
#: them as unknown options, so PDF/X and the CMYK profile paths cannot run at
#: all there.
#:
#: The floor is set at 10.0 rather than 9.50 because 9.5x still shipped the
#: PostScript-based PDF interpreter alongside the C one, and `compare` reads
#: the interpreter's own page-tree behaviour — a short render at rc 0 is how a
#: document end is discovered — to decide what to report. Driving an
#: interpreter generation that behaviour was never measured against risks a
#: WRONG comparison rather than a refusal, and a wrong result is the outcome
#: this whole capability layer exists to avoid. 10.x is also the only
#: generation the suites exercise. This is a minimum, never a pin.
