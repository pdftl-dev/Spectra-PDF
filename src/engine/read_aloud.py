"""A page's text as a READER hears it: ordered blocks, with the geometry to
highlight any character range of one.

Two questions, answered per page and both reported:

*Which order?* The structure tree's, when the page's whole non-artifact
content is in it — the order the document's own producer declared. Otherwise
the extraction's own order, and the caller is told which ran. Half a page in
one order and half in the other would be an order that is neither, with
nothing to tell a listener which sentences moved, so the choice is
all-or-nothing per page.

*Where is character n?* Blocks are the SHIPPED paragraph lister's paragraphs,
so their text is already in logical order for a right-to-left paragraph (which
is what a synthesizer must be handed) and their `spans` are already a
character-range→run map. This module refines a span to per-CHARACTER
rectangles by walking the run's own drawn codes, and says per span whether it
managed to: a span whose characters were proved to sit one-to-one on the codes
that drew them carries `chars`, and one where the proof failed carries the
whole run's rectangle and `exact: false`. Nothing here guesses, and a caller
never has to wonder how precise a rectangle is.

Rectangles are one per RUN, never a box bounded across runs —
`search_text_regions`' rule 3, for the same reason: a phrase that wraps
belongs in two rectangles, not in one that swallows the margin.

Marked-content sections tagged `/Artifact` are excluded from both orders. The
tag is the producer stating the content is a running header, a folio or a
rule; speaking page furniture between every page is the defect it exists to
prevent.

A run no paragraph admits — text set at an angle, a column whose glyphs climb
— is a block of its own, placed in layout order by its top edge: the
paragraph lister leaving it on the run-box surface says it cannot be
reflowed, not that it is not on the page. A run whose box has no area paints
nothing and is not read.
