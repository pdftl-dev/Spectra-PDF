"""What paints one point on a page: the object, its colour space, its resolution.

Three readouts answer one click, and they are three separate measurements on
purpose.

**Which object.** A paint-order walk lists what could be at the point and what
each of those objects is; one Ghostscript `pngalpha` run over a tile around
the point says which of them actually paints that pixel. A bounding box is a
SUPERSET of the mark it bounds — a glyph's counter, an image's soft mask, an
even-odd fill's hole and a non-rectangular clip are all regions the geometry
calls inside and the device leaves blank — so a readout that stopped at the
box would confidently name an object nobody is looking at. `pngalpha` is the
device because white paint is paint: a colour test reads a white fill on white
paper as nothing.

**How much ink.** Read off the PLATE coverage at that pixel, never derived
from the object. Where the object is already device CMYK the two agree to the
plate's 8-bit quantisation; where it is not they are different units, and
"red" is not an amount of ink. Both are reported under their own labels and
neither is blended into the other. The read covers every plate in the set and
not a chosen subset — a hidden plate is still an ink on the sheet — and no
display transform enters it, because nothing shown on screen changes how much
ink a press lays down.

**What resolution.** `image_resolution._measure` on the placement the hit test
picked. A vector, a text run and a shading have no resolution and say so; a
placement whose pixel dimensions or placed size are degenerate reports the
unmeasured third state rather than a number.

Frames: the caller hands over a PDF user-space point and nothing else. User
space does not move under `/Rotate` — only the projection does — so the
projection stays with whoever drew the page on screen. The plate pixel is
derived here, once, because the plates carry `/Rotate` and the crop origin
themselves; the scale comes from the plate's own pixel extent against the
page's own box, so the device's rounding of a fractional pixel edge cannot
drift the mapping.

The isolation unit is PAGE-level, so a form XObject isolates whole: the raster
answers "something inside this form paints here" and the walk's geometry ranks
which nested object it is. Two nested objects over one point are reported as a
stack with the ambiguity stated, never resolved silently.
