"""Hairlines — the stroke widths that survive proofing and vanish on press.

**The measurement is the EFFECTIVE device width, `line_width × sqrt(|det CTM|)`,
never the raw `w` operand.** A `1 w` under a `0.1 0 0 0.1 0 0 cm` draws a
0.1 pt line; reading the operand alone would miss it, and writing the
replacement into the operand alone would over-correct it by ten. The fix
therefore writes `replacement / scale`, so the DEVICE width lands on the
replacement whatever the transform above it.

**`0 w` is a hairline unconditionally.** PDF defines it as the thinnest line
the device can draw — about 0.03 pt on an imagesetter — and a Ghostscript
round trip passes it through untouched while rewriting every other width, so
nothing downstream will ever fix it.

**An annotation border inverts the zero rule.** There a width of `0` means NO
border, not the thinnest one, so a zero is left exactly alone. What carries is
`/BS /W`, `/Border[2]`, and the strokes inside the appearance stream that is
what actually prints — which is where a widget's own border is drawn.

The rewrite wraps each hairline's operator run in `q … Q` with the corrected
`w` inside, so the correction reaches that object and nothing after it. A run
with graphics-state operators interleaved into it takes the setter at paint
time (where it beats an interleaved `w`) and replays the interleaved ops after
the closing `Q`, which is the same shape the vector restyle uses and the same
reason.
