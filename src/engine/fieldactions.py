"""The `/AA` and `/A` action kinds that are DATA rather than code.

`engine.afscript` reads the `/JavaScript` half of a field's actions; this
module reads and writes the other half -- the action dictionaries that carry a
destination, a URL, a field subset, a visibility change or a file to import.
None of them is a script, so all of them can be both reported and RUN without a
JavaScript engine.

The wire shape is one classified dict per action, and it is the same vocabulary
the renderer speaks (``src/renderer/lib/field-actions.ts``)::

    {"kind": "goto",   "page": int | None}
    {"kind": "uri",    "uri": str}
    {"kind": "reset",  "fields": [str] | None, "exclude": bool}
    {"kind": "submit", "url": str, "format": "fdf"|"html"|"xfdf"|"pdf",
                       "method": "post"|"get", "fields": [str] | None,
                       "exclude": bool, "include_empty": bool}
    {"kind": "hide",   "targets": [str], "hide": bool}
    {"kind": "import", "file": str}
    {"kind": "named",  "name": str}
    {"kind": "javascript"}
    {"kind": "remote", "file": str}
    {"kind": "other",  "action": str}

``javascript``, ``remote`` and ``other`` are REPORTED and never run: the first
because this app runs no arbitrary form scripts, the second because it reaches
another document, the third because nothing here can say what it does. Every
one of them keeps its bytes.

Triggers. ``A`` is the widget's activation action -- what a pushbutton does
when it is clicked, and the key every producer writes for one. The rest are
`/AA` keys: ``D`` mouse down, ``U`` mouse up, ``E`` pointer enter, ``X``
pointer exit, ``Fo`` focus, ``Bl`` blur. The four value triggers (`/K` `/V`
`/C` `/F`) belong to `engine.afscript` and are deliberately absent here -- a
value trigger carrying a non-script action is not one this app runs.
