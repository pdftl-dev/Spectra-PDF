"""Headless batch OCR -- the folder-mirror driver, engine side.

This is the port of `src/renderer/lib/batch-ocr.ts`. It exists so a batch can
run with NO WINDOW: that is what makes the CLI arm possible, and the CLI arm is
what makes scheduling possible. The GUI keeps its own
TypeScript driver for the interactive case; this one serves the CLI and every
scheduled run.

**The two must agree.** Where they overlap, the behaviour here is deliberately
the same and the reasons are the same:

  - classification is ocr / copied / skipped, per file, and one file's failure
    never stops the run;
  - a page "needs OCR" only when it has fewer than 16 real glyphs AND the page
    actually paints a raster image -- a genuinely blank page is not a scan;
  - the destination may not be, or be inside, the source;
  - the moved/error folders are OPT-IN, the output is VERIFIED before any
    original moves, and a failed move never changes a file's status;
  - the log is byte-compatible with `lib/batch-log.ts`, because a run logged
    one way by the GUI and another way by the scheduler would make the audit
    trail useless exactly where it matters most.

    write can never leave a half-written original. Returns the report.

    `passwords` maps a source's RELATIVE path (or its bare file name) to
    the password that opens it. Supplied UP FRONT rather than prompted:
    a batch is exactly the run that has nobody to ask — a scheduled job under
    a service account has no desktop — so the credential has to arrive with
    the request. A file with no entry keeps the shipped behaviour and is
    skipped as `password-protected`, which is what lets a caller run once,
    read the report, and re-run just the files it now has passwords for.

    `include_images` adds loose image files (PNG/JPEG/TIFF/BMP) to the
    sweep. Each is wrapped into a one-page PDF at its own natural size and
    then travels the identical path; the mirrored name gains `.pdf` rather
    than replacing the extension, so `invoice.tif` and `invoice.pdf` in one

    `mrc` MRC-compresses each processed file AFTER recognition:
    recognition rasterises from the page, so the reverse order would hand

    option that could just compress automatically": the user with a folder of
    smartphone scans is standing in this run. A file MRC declines — anything
    that is not a scan — keeps the bytes it already had and says so; MRC
    never fails a file whose searchable copy already succeeded.

    `enhance` deskews, despeckles, whitens and re-orients each file BEFORE
    recognition — the same structural order as `mrc`'s, seen from the other
    end (`_enhance_step`). It stages into its own temp beside the output, so
