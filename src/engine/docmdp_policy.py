"""The difference policy used to judge changes against a DocMDP certification.

The bundled standard policy carries no rules for annotations: it clears form
filling and long-term-validation material, and everything else — including an
annotation a certification explicitly permits — falls through as an
unexplained change and reports as an illegal modification. Verifying a
document certified for commenting therefore has to be done against a policy
that models commenting, or every permitted comment is reported as tampering.

This module supplies that one missing rule and composes it with the standard
ones. Five invariants hold it to what the certification actually permits:

  * The annotation rule clears a page's ``/Annots`` MEMBERSHIP and the
    annotation objects it reaches, never any other page key. A cleared
    content-stream swap is exactly the change the DocMDP transform exists to
    detect, so a page whose other keys differ is not cleared at all and stays
    suspicious under the standard rules.
  * A WIDGET annotation OBJECT is never cleared here. Widgets are form fields,
    they belong to the form rules, and clearing one here would let a field
    appear on a page without its ``/AcroForm`` registration ever being vetted.
    The rule also stays out of the way entirely on a page whose only membership
    change is a widget, so that adding a signature field keeps being judged at
    the level the form rules judge it at.
  * The rule is qualified at the ANNOTATIONS level, so it changes nothing under
    a certification that permits only form filling or no changes at all — those
    verdicts compare the modification level against the permission level, and a
    change cleared only at the annotation level still exceeds a lower one.
  * The policy is used for VALIDATION only, and is passed explicitly at its one
    call site rather than installed as a default, so no other caller inherits it.
  * An object the rule cannot read is treated as one it may not clear.
