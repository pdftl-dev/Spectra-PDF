"""The ONE graphics/text-state machine for content-stream walkers.

One interpreter, two clients, no drift: redaction (`redact.py`), image editing (`page_images.py`), and text
editing all walk content streams tracking the same PDF graphics state —
CTM (q/Q/cm), text matrices (BT, Tm/Td/TD/T*), and text parameters
(Tf or ExtGState font and size, TL leading, Tz horizontal scale). Before this
module each walker re-derived the tracking; a divergence between them is
exactly the class of bug that edits the wrong thing.

The seam is deliberately narrow: `GraphicsTextState.feed()` consumes
STATE-BEARING operators and reports whether it did; every client keeps
its own control flow (what to keep, drop, rewrite, recurse) and handles
show/Do operators itself using the state's fields and helpers. Feeding
never rewrites — this is a tracker, not a transformer.

The no-drift proof is redact.py's full pytest suite running unchanged
against the refactored `_walk`: the security-critical client is the
regression harness for the seam.

    """Track the active clip region across one instruction stream, ADDITIVELY
    alongside `GraphicsTextState` (never inside its `feed()` — the state machine
    5 walkers depend on stays byte-for-byte untouched).

    Extracted from the tracker `redact.py` grew for its `sh`
    leak fix: every content walker that lists or strips content
    needs to know whether a bbox is CLIPPED AWAY (invisible), not just where it
    sits. Before this, clipped-invisible text/images/vectors still listed as
    editable everywhere the shared walk is used.

    The clip is approximated by the clip PATH'S BOUNDING BOX, which is always a
    SUPERSET of the true clip region (the path itself ⊆ its bbox). So
    `clips_away(bbox)` returning True — the content's bbox is fully outside the
    clip bbox — means the content is DEFINITELY invisible; a False can still be
    clipped by the true (non-rectangular) path, so callers err toward KEEPING
    content, the safe direction for a listing and for redaction alike.

    `feed(operator, operands, ctm)` mirrors redact's original inline tracker:
    q pushes / Q pops the clip (it is graphics state), W|W* arm a pending clip,
    the path-construction ops accumulate device-space points under `ctm`, and a
    path-ending op intersects the accumulated path's bbox into the clip. `ctm`
    is the CTM in effect at THIS operator — path-point ops never change the CTM,
    so passing the current `GraphicsTextState.ctm` (fed BEFORE its own `feed`)
    is correct. The clip is stored in DEVICE space, so q/Q save/restore need no
    re-transformation (the clip on the physical page does not move when the CTM
    is popped).

    `base_clip` seeds the clip a nested Form XObject INHERITS from its invoking
    `Do` (a form runs in the caller's graphics state, ISO 32000 §8.10.2). The
    listers pass the parent's device-space clip so a form drawn wholly outside
    it flags its content clipped; redaction keeps the default None (unbounded)
    per stream — its `sh` then "covers everything" and is removed, redaction's
    safe over-removal direction and its long-pinned behaviour.
