"""PostScript/EPS → PDF conversion (distilling) via Ghostscript's
pdfwrite device.

The compress.py invocation template: bundled gs, pdfwrite, -dSAFER (the
input is an untrusted PROGRAM — PostScript is a full language), a DERIVED
time budget (engine/budget.py — a fixed one fails on exactly the big inputs
the op exists for), stderr surfaced on failure. Input honesty is a HEADER check
(`%!`), not an extension check: a PDF fed here would re-render (that's
Repair Tier 2's job), and arbitrary bytes refuse with the reason named.
A Windows spool stream arrives wrapped in a PJL envelope (UEL, `@PJL`
control lines, `@PJL ENTER LANGUAGE=POSTSCRIPT`) and may carry a UEL/@PJL
trailer; only the LEADING prologue is parsed off before the header check,
and a copy stripped of just that prologue is what reaches Ghostscript, so
the distilled input is PostScript rather than something gs merely
tolerates. Any trailer stays in the payload: Ghostscript consumes it, and
no suffix scan can distinguish trailing control text from image samples
that happen to spell the same bytes. An envelope declaring another
language refuses by that name.
The output is post-validated by opening it with pikepdf — a zero exit
from gs is not proof of a well-formed PDF.
