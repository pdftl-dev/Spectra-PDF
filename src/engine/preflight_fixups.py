"""What repairing a preflight finding MEANS — one table, one order.

Nineteen of the twenty fixups are an existing op called with the parameters a
profile carries; ``font_embed.embed_missing_fonts`` is the twentieth. The panel
button, the command line, the droplet and the guided-action step all call
THIS, so "what does fixing `hairlines_absent` mean" has one answer rather than
one per surface — the `accessibility_fixes` ruling applied to a second checker.

**The ORDER is canonical and a profile may not change it.** ``fixups`` in a
profile is a SET; the order below is the engine's, and the result reports the
order it actually ran. The reason is that each stage changes what the next one
measures:

  1. strip (JavaScript, attachments, annotations) — before anything rewrites
     the file, so the rewrite does not carry what is about to be deleted;
  2. embed missing fonts — BEFORE any Ghostscript stage, because ``pdfwrite``
     re-embeds what it can and substitutes what it cannot, and embedding first
     is what makes the substitution not happen;
  3. the colour conversion;
  4. the spot work — after the conversion, because a colorant's tint transform
     targets its alternate space and the conversion has just re-described it;
  5. downsampling — after the conversion (fewer components to resample) and
     before flattening (so the region raster is computed against the final
     image data);
  6. hairlines — BEFORE flattening. A hairline inside a rasterized region
     becomes pixels at the flatten resolution, where nothing can reach it
     again;
  7. flattening — after everything that edits vector content;
  8. the boxes — geometry, unaffected by content edits, and required before
     marks (``printer_marks.resolve_trim``);
  9. metadata — last before the standard conversion, which writes its own
     version and its own ``/GTS_PDFXVersion``;
 10. the standard conversion — the whole-file ``pdfwrite`` rewrite;
 11. printer marks — AFTER it, deliberately. ``pdfwrite`` regenerates every
     object, so marks added before it survive as content but lose their
     ``/SpectraPrinterMarks`` record and could never be removed again.

A door that refuses does not stop the run: its refusal is recorded against its
fixup and the rest still land. A run where NOTHING landed and something
refused raises, so a caller asking for one fixup gets that fixup's own refusal
rather than an empty success.

A door may also land PARTLY. Its `changed` then counts only what the file
actually carries, and the row names the rest under `partial` — a count that
included what the door could not finish would report a repair the document
does not have.

        profile: A shipped profile id, or the rule itself as an object.
        profile_path: A profile file. Exactly one of the two.
        checks: Check ids (what a row's Fix control sends) or fixup ids, or
            None for every fixup the profile carries.
        report: The check this pass is answering, when the caller already has
            one. A panel and a sweep both run the report before they offer a
            fix, and total area coverage is a Ghostscript run per page — so
            the measurement is taken once and handed on rather than repeated.
            None runs it here.
        gs_path: Ghostscript, for the colour, downsample and standard stages.
        font_dir: The vendored faces, for flattening and printer marks.
        tesseract_path: Passed to `compress`, which accepts it for its MRC arm.

    Returns ``{output, order, applied, skipped, refused, before, after,
    report}``. `order` is the sequence that actually ran, which is the
    profile's set put into the engine's order — never the profile's own
    listing.

    An `applied` row is ``{fixup, changed}``, and carries `partial` when the
    door landed some of what it was asked for and not the rest: one
    ``{item, reasons, …}`` record per thing the output does NOT carry, keyed
    by `item` whatever the door works in, so one reader serves every door.
    `changed` never counts those, so a row with ``changed`` 0 and a `partial`
    list is a door that edited the file and finished none of what it named.
