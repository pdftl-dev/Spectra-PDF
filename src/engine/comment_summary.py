"""The comment SUMMARY — the review model, and the document that carries it.

Two ops, one model.

`list_comments` reads the whole review model: author, both dates, subject,
state, name, and the reply thread. `list_annotations` returns five fields and
stays exactly as it is — the Comments overview count and the spelling
checker's annotation walk both depend on its shape.

`summarize_comments` authors a NEW PDF: the source page as an image with the
comments laid out beside or beneath it and lines drawn from each comment's
position to its entry. The page image is `watermark._lift_page`, not the
Ghostscript flatten: `-dUseCropBox` translates the origin, so connector math
that read rects from the original and geometry from the flattened copy would
be wrong by the crop origin on every cropped page; and a comment whose /F
lacks the print bit does not survive that flatten in either mode, so a summary
built on it would list a comment and point a line at blank paper.
`_lift_page` folds the crop origin into the form's own /Matrix and draws every
annotation that is neither Hidden nor NoView, which is a review artefact's
semantics rather than a press plate's.

Because the form's /Matrix already folds the crop origin, the placement matrix
is composed with it directly — `sheet = place_in_cell(...) · /Matrix · point`.
The extra crop-origin subtraction an imposition does belongs to a form built
by `Page.as_form_xobject`, whose /Matrix is the identity and whose /BBox
origin is the crop origin; applying it here would shift every cropped page by
its crop origin twice.

The placement math is `print_layout.place_in_cell`; the page lift and the
appearance placement are `watermark`'s. What is new here is a column of
authored text with lines drawn to the artwork beside it.

ORDERING AND FILTERING LIVE HERE, not in a panel: the document author, the
on-screen list and the command line are three readers of one order, and a sort
the on-screen list could not reproduce would be a second answer to "which
comments, in what order".

The reconciliation invariant every summary states and every test asserts:

    found == written + filtered + unmodelled

`found` counts every annotation on a readable page that could be a comment —
everything except /Popup (it rides its parent), /Widget (a form field) and
/Link (a navigation region). `filtered` is what the caller's filter removed;
`unmodelled` is a subtype outside the shipped markup set. Comments written
WITHOUT a badge (no readable /Rect) and comments whose body would not lay out
are counted separately: they are written, so they are already inside
`written`, and the counts say what was lost about them.

The engine never translates. Furniture strings arrive as `labels`, resolved by
the caller from its own catalog; the defaults below are the English the
command line gets. Bodies, author names and subjects are authored content and
are emitted verbatim.
