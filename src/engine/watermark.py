"""Watermark: stamp translucent text, an image OR a PDF page across pages.

Approach (per page): author a small Form XObject carrying the stamp ops and
its OWN private /Resources (standard-14 Helvetica, the shared image
XObject, or the shared lifted-page form, plus an /ExtGState with the
requested alpha), then attach it with
pikepdf's ``Page.add_overlay`` / ``add_underlay``. Using the library's
overlay API instead of hand-editing
``page.Contents`` sidesteps two traps the redaction review taught us:

  - **Inherited /Resources** — assigning ``page.Resources`` to register a
    font would SHADOW a resources dict inherited from an ancestor /Pages
    node (the same generator pattern ``redact._resolve_resources`` walks the
    /Parent chain for). The form carries its font privately, so the page's
    resource dict only ever gains the collision-safely-named form itself.
  - **Unbalanced graphics state** — add_overlay q/Q-shields the stamp from
    whatever state the existing content leaves dangling.

**The form's box is the DISPLAYED page box, and its coordinates are the
reader's.** ``add_overlay`` places a form into the rectangle *as displayed*:
on a /Rotate 90 or 270 page it writes a rotation into the placement matrix
and matches the form's BBox against the SWAPPED dimensions. Two consequences,
both load-bearing:

  - The BBox is ``[0 0 disp_w disp_h]``, so the fit-scale is exactly 1 at
    every /Rotate. A BBox in un-rotated user dimensions makes qpdf scale the
    stamp by ``min(W/H, H/W)`` on a rotated non-square page.
  - ``angle`` is drawn as given. It already means degrees in the displayed
    orientation, and the placement matrix supplies the /Rotate part; adding
    /Rotate here again turns the stamp a second time and lays it on its side.

/Rotate and the crop/media boxes are inheritable page attributes — resolved
via pdf_tree.walk_inheritable, the one shared /Parent-chain walk that
redact's resource lookup also uses (one implementation, so a fix propagates
to every consumer).

The IMAGE and PDF-PAGE sources embed ONCE per call: the picture is decoded
and encoded, or the source page is lifted, a single time before the page loop
and made indirect, and every page's form references that one XObject through
its own /Resources.

Placement (position, tiling) is shared by all three sources — one helper
decides where the stamp centres go, and each source only knows how to draw
itself at a centre.

Deliberately NOT Ghostscript: a gs pdfwrite round-trip regenerates the
whole file to add one stream per page, and GS-backed ops don't run in dev
until the bundle script has been run.

        text: Watermark text. Latin-1 draws with WinAnsi Helvetica; anything
            outside it embeds a subsetted Unicode face from ``font_dir``, and
            is refused by name when no bundled face covers it.

            (45 = classic diagonal).

        font_size: Points; 0 auto-fits per page (~65% of the displayed
            extent along the text direction).
        layer: ``"over"`` (default — survives scans/opaque fills) or
            ``"under"`` (classic behind-the-text watermark).
        pages: 1-based page numbers; None = all pages, an explicit empty
            list = ZERO pages (matching rotate.py's convention — an empty
            selection must never silently widen to the whole document; the
            CLI's --pages parse rejects garbage for the same reason).
            Out-of-range entries are ignored (same convention as redact).
        image: Path to a picture to stamp INSTEAD of text — exactly one of
            ``text``, ``image`` and ``pdf_source`` is the source. Accepted
            extensions are Create PDF's own image set. The picture embeds ONCE
            per call and every page references that one XObject.
        pdf_source: Path to a PDF whose page is stamped as VECTOR artwork —
            a letterhead, a pre-drawn stamp. The page is lifted as one Form
            XObject, embedded ONCE per call, and nothing is rasterized. The
            source's own /Rotate is honoured and its visible annotations are
            drawn with it.
        pdf_page: 1-based page of ``pdf_source`` to lift (default 1).
        scale: Multiplier on the auto fit (the size at which the stamp's
            rotated bounding box fills ~65% of the displayed page box).
            Values above 1 may overflow the page, which is a real request.
        position: One of ``POSITIONS``, named in the DISPLAYED orientation.
        margin: Points inset from the page box for the non-centred anchors.
        tile: Repeat the stamp across the whole page box on a centred grid;
            ``position`` is ignored while tiling.
        tile_gap: Points between tiles in both directions.
        writing_mode: ``"horizontal"`` (default, byte-identical to omitting
            it), ``"vertical"``, ``"vertical-rl"`` or ``"vertical-lr"``. A
            vertical stamp is one COLUMN reading down the page, turned by
