"""Separation preview — the ink inventory and the separation raster.

Three capabilities, in the order the preview uses them.

`list_inks` enumerates the `/Separation` and `/DeviceN` colorants a page can
paint with, resolving each to a display colour through `color_spaces`. It
reports what it could NOT read beside what it found: a resource branch the
walk skipped may hold an ink, and a plate inventory that answered only with
what it reached would hide one.

`render_separations` rasterizes one page to one 8-bit grayscale plate per
separation through Ghostscript's `tiffsep` device. **Plate polarity is
inverted: 0 is FULL ink and 255 is no ink.** The 4-channel composite the
device writes alongside the plates folds spots into process and therefore
cannot drive a spot toggle — the preview composites from the individual
plates instead.

`composite_separations` turns a chosen subset of those plates into an RGB PNG
plus the total-ink statistics, in numpy, so toggling an ink never re-runs
Ghostscript. With a simulation profile it composites through `soft_proof`
instead: the coverages become a CMYK accumulation buffer and one ICC
transform takes that buffer to sRGB. Without one the arithmetic is
byte-for-byte what it always was.

**Overprint can only be simulated by the separation device.** Every RGB device
renders an overprinting fill identically to a knocking-out one, so no RGB
raster — including the viewer's own — can show overprint. `-dOverprint=/disable`
turns the simulation off; nothing turns it on, because it is the default.

**`inkcov` is a page average, not an alarm.** On a page whose true maximum
total ink is 340 %, its four fractions sum to 200 %. It ships as what it is —
per-ink page coverage — and the over-limit alarm reads the per-pixel maximum
off the plates.

**Every stage frames on the CropBox.** `-dUseCropBox` puts the plates and the
coverage measurement in the frame the viewer shows. Without it a page whose
CropBox is smaller than its MediaBox rasters the larger box: the composite
stretches over a region the page never displays, and every figure measured off
it — the ink list, the per-ink coverage, the total-area alarm, the soft proof —
describes area the reader cannot see. Ghostscript intersects the CropBox with
the MediaBox, normalizes a reversed one and falls back to the MediaBox on an
empty one, which is what the viewer's own page box does, so the two frames
agree with no further normalization; both also apply `/Rotate` themselves. A
staged intermediate carries the CropBox through `pdfwrite` verbatim, so the
flag frames the staged separation too.

            The default excludes them, which is what a plate list is FOR: a
            die line is a manufacturing instruction, not an ink, and a
            varnish colorant on the plate list would be one more plate the
            job does not have and one more ink in every total-ink figure
            measured over it. A colorant the artwork also paints stays —
            exclusion is per COLORANT, not per layer.

    Each entry carries the colorant name verbatim (an ink name is document
    content and is never translated), its kind, its alternate space, an sRGB
    display colour taken at full tint, the pages it appears on, and the
    resource categories it was reached through.

    A colorant IS the bytes of its name (ISO 32000-2 §7.3.5, §8.6.6.4): the
    device plates by them and two names that differ in one byte are two
    inks. `key` carries those bytes, in hex, and is the identity a caller
    hands back; `name` is their text, read as UTF-8 where they are UTF-8 and
    escaped where they are not, and is for showing.

    `color_families` is every colour family the pages carry, resource spaces
    and inline device operators alike. It is what decides whether a soft
    proof has to colour-manage the page before separating it: a page made
    only of DeviceCMYK, Separation and DeviceN separates to the document's
    own ink numbers on any press, and anything else on it reached the plates
    through Ghostscript's compiled-in default.

    `unknown` is the other half of the answer. A resource branch the walk
    could not read may hold a colorant, so an inventory that reported only
    what it reached would present a plate list it has not earned — the ink
    would be missing from the plate inventory and from every total-ink figure
    measured over it, with nothing saying so. The list is empty on a document
    the walk read whole, and a caller must not read a non-empty one as
    "nothing else there".
