"""Add Text — author a NEW text object on a page.

The counterpart to the editing path: instead of rewriting existing runs,
this APPENDS a fresh text object. It reuses the subset-embed
(`build_fallback_font` → Type0/Identity-H + ToUnicode), so the authored
text is searchable AND re-editable by the run and paragraph editors with no
special case — the next `list_text_runs`/`list_text_paragraphs` sees it as
an ordinary editable run.

Pure authoring: no content-stream surgery of existing content. The new
drawing is wrapped in `q … Q` so it can't inherit or leak graphics state,
and positioned in USER space at the page's top level (identity ctm — no
inversion needed, unlike the paragraph emitter's in-context rewrite).
`rotate` wraps that same block in one 90°-step rotation frame
(`cm`) mapping the local layout onto the drawn box; rotate=0 emits the
frame-less shipped bytes.
`bold`/`italic` compose the style into the same fallback
ladder (both face seats), and `measure_text_box` reports the identical
layout without writing — ONE shared `_layout_box` pass for both ops (the
walker-agreement discipline), so the card's fit indicator can never
disagree with the commit.
