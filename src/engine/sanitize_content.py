"""Content-stream analysis for text a reader cannot see.

Four things make text invisible without removing it from the file, and an
extractor reads all four exactly as it reads visible text:

  1. a non-painting render mode (``3 Tr``, and ``7 Tr`` which only clips);
  2. a fill colour equal to whatever is painted under the run;
  3. a later opaque object drawn over it;
  4. membership of an optional-content group that is OFF in the default
     configuration.

The walk is one depth-first pass that emits an ORDERED event list — text
shows, painted fills, image placements — because three of the four detectors
are questions about what was painted BEFORE or AFTER a run, and a separate
walk per detector could not answer them consistently. Form XObjects recurse at
their ``Do`` position, so event order is paint order.

Two conservatisms are deliberate, both in the direction of leaving content
alone:

  * a covering object counts only when it is an AXIS-ALIGNED rectangle (or an
    axis-aligned image placement). A general path's bounding box claims more
    coverage than the path paints, and acting on that claim deletes text a
    reader can see.
  * PARTIAL coverage is reported and never removed. The uncovered half is
    content.

Run ids are the depth-first show-operator encounter order. The analysis walk
and the removal walk below share that traversal shape, which is what makes an
id from one addressable by the other.
