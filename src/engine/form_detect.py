"""Automatic form-field detection — candidates, never fields.

The door reports CANDIDATE regions for a flat form: ruled fill-in lines, boxed
entry areas, checkboxes and radio options, each with the label it binds to, an
inferred type and a derived field name. It writes nothing. Acceptance — and the
authoring that follows it — is the caller's, which is what makes a heuristic
safe to run: a suggestion that mutates nothing is a suggestion.

Four rules the geometry forces:

1. **One walk, both channels.** `_walk_vectors(..., geometry=True)` emits a
   path's device-space bbox AND its flattened subpaths in a single pass. Both
   are needed and neither substitutes for the other: the bbox carries
   `line_width`, which is the rule test, while a circle and a square list with
   identical bboxes and differ only in their subpaths' point count. Joining the
   two shipped listings instead would mean joining two separate ordinal spaces
   by geometry, i.e. a second implementation of "what is on this page".

2. **Labels come from LINE segments, not from show operators.** One show
   operator can carry two labels separated by nothing but spaces; binding
   per-operator gives one rule the whole string and the other nothing. Runs are
   clustered into lines by the search walk's own clustering, then split where
   the drawn gap exceeds `SEGMENT_GAP_SPACES` space advances.

3. **A rule with no label to its left is not offered.** Rule spacing cannot
   separate a fill-in stack from a table: four fill-in rules 40 pt apart at one
   x-extent have the same signature as three table rules. The label is the
   discriminator. Such rules are COUNTED in `unoffered` — found and withheld is
   a reportable outcome, silence is not.

4. **A group's label direction is decided once for the whole group, and the
   group's question is excluded from the option-label pool.** Per-option
   nearest-label search reuses the previous option's label, and the first
   option of a row takes the question above it; both produce duplicate names,
   which the authoring layer refuses mid-batch.

Comb ticks are absorbed into their enclosing box rather than offered as
vertical-rule candidates, and a region an existing widget already covers is
subtracted here so re-running detection on a half-prepared form does not double
every field.
