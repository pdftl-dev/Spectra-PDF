"""Scan enhancement — deskew, despeckle, background whitening, orientation.

A scan arrives with the defects of the machine that made it: the sheet went
through the feeder a degree or two off square, the platen threw dust, the
paper photographed as grey rather than white, and the page went in sideways.
Each of those is a MEASUREMENT of the page before it is a correction of it,
and every measurement this module needs already exists in `engine/mrc.py`:

  * `_classify_page` decides whether a page IS a scan — one upright image
    covering the page and nothing else drawn over it. Reused rather than
    re-derived, so "is this a scan" has exactly one answer in the product;
  * `segment` measures the page's own glyph height, Sauvola-binarizes it at
    the window that measurement asks for, and separates pictorial regions
    (photographs, halftones) from type;
  * `components` labels connected components by union-find over row runs;
  * `masked_mean` estimates the paper as `blur(I·paper)/blur(paper)`.

Four arms, three of which rewrite pixels and one of which does not:

1. **Deskew** — a projection-profile search over a SHEARED accumulation
   (bin `y + x·tan θ`, score the profile's own first-difference energy).
   Binning rather than rotating is what makes the search affordable; a
   rotation per candidate angle would be a full resample of the page each
   time. Measured worst error over -12°..+8°: 0.02°.
2. **Despeckle** — small, non-pictorial, ISOLATED components painted with the
   local paper estimate. All three conditions are required: a period is small
   and a halftone dot is small, and neither is a speck.
3. **Background** — a flat-field divide by the local paper estimate, which
   removes a gradient (a gutter shadow, an uneven platen) rather than merely
   lightening it.
4. **Orientation** — `tesseract --psm 0`, applied as the page's `/Rotate`.
   LOSSLESS: it never touches a pixel.

Correctness constraints:

1. **Skew is measured on the ORIGINAL samples.** A measurement taken after a
   bicubic rotation measures the interpolation as much as the page.
2. **Despeckle and background run BEFORE the rotation**, for the same reason:
   a speck smeared by bicubic interpolation is no longer a compact component,
   and the mask that would have caught it misses.
3. **The segmentation is computed ONCE per page** and feeds all three raster
   arms. Two segmentations that disagreed would be two answers to "where is
   the ink".
4. **The raster keeps its pixel dimensions and its channel count.** The
   rotation is `expand=False` with a paper fill, so the placement's CTM stays
   exactly valid; a greyscale scan stays greyscale rather than being tripled
   into RGB.
5. **The output codec follows the source's own class.** A lossy source
   re-encodes as JPEG, a lossless one as Flate — an enhancement must not
   silently inflate a file, nor silently degrade a lossless one.

DECISION_SCAN = "scan"
DECISION_ENHANCED = "enhanced"
#: The page IS a scan and every enabled arm measured nothing to do — a
#: distinct decision from "untouched", because the two mean different things
#: to whoever reads the report: one page was not a scan, the other was already
#: square, clean and white.
DECISION_UNCHANGED = "unchanged"

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Defaults, each measured rather than chosen — the measurement is stated on
# the constant it produced, and pinned in `tests/test_enhance_scan.py`.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#: Search half-range, degrees. Larger than any sheet feeder produces, small
#: enough that a page of ruled tables cannot lock onto a spurious far peak.
DEFAULT_MAX_SKEW = 10.0
#: Below this the rotation is resampling that costs sharpness and buys
#: nothing, so the angle is REPORTED and not applied. This is also what makes
#: deskew idempotent: the residual after one pass measures ~0.02°.
DEFAULT_MIN_SKEW = 0.1
#: Largest half-range a caller may ask for. Past 45° the question is
#: orientation, not skew, and OSD answers it losslessly.
MAX_SKEW_LIMIT = 45.0
#: Speck bounding-box side, INCHES so the threshold is resolution-independent.
#: Swept on a clean page and the same page with injected specks: 0.010 in
#: removes 430 specks and 0 real marks, 0.014 in removes 499 specks and 68
#: REAL MARKS — at 300 dpi that is 4 px, and a full stop at 11 pt is about 4 px
#: across. The default sits one step below the first false positive.
DEFAULT_SPECK_SIZE_IN = 0.01
#: A speck must have no substantial ink within this distance. What protects a
#: period, an i-dot, an accent and a dotted leader: each is small, none alone.
DEFAULT_SPECK_GAP_IN = 0.02
#: Mean paper level, 0-255, at or above which the background arm declines.
#: Not a cosmetic guard: without it every page would be decoded and re-encoded
#: on every run, so a second pass over an already-enhanced document would
#: spend a JPEG generation to change nothing. Measured — a page this pass has
#: already whitened reads 252.7-253.9, and the dimmest page that still wants
#: work reads 242.9, so 250 sits between the two populations.
BACKGROUND_TRIGGER = 250.0
#: Tesseract OSD orientation confidence floor. Measured over the constructed
#: fixtures: the worst CORRECT determination scored 15.02 (upright) and the
#: best UNUSABLE one scored 0.92 (a blank page). 2.0 sits between the two
#: populations — above every reading from a page that had nothing to read, and
#: 7.5x below the weakest reading from a page that did.
DEFAULT_OSD_CONFIDENCE = 2.0
#: Re-encode quality for a lossy source. High enough that the second
#: generation does not spend the pass's gain on JPEG artefacts, low enough not
#: to inflate the file: measured against the quality-80 skew fixture, 85 came
#: out at 1.04x the source and 90 at 1.37x.
DEFAULT_JPEG_QUALITY = 85
#: Paper-estimate reduction. The estimate has to be coarse enough to be paper
#: and fine enough to follow a gutter shadow; 1/8 of the page is both.
PAPER_DIV = 8
#: The Sauvola k the analysis runs at — `PRESETS["balanced"]`'s value. Named
#: here rather than imported from a preset: this pass has no presets, and
#: borrowing a compression preset's name for a threshold that is not about
#: compression would tie two unrelated knobs together.
SEGMENT_K = 0.20
#: The skew search binarizes a DOWNSAMPLED page — measured, full-res Sauvola
#: costs ~700 ms and returns +2.75 where half-res costs ~174 ms and returns

SKEW_TARGET_DPI = 150
#: Ink points the search scores. 50k / 100k / 200k / 400k all returned the
