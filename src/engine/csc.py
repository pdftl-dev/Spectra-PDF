"""Cloud Signature Consortium API client — remote signing over a digest.

The protocol is CSC API **2.2.0.0** (the specification's own ``specs`` value,
§11.1). What this module provides is the minimum a signer needs: service
discovery (``info``, §11.1), OAuth 2.0 service authorization (``oauth2/token``,
§8.2.4), credential enumeration (``credentials/list`` §11.6,
``credentials/info`` §11.7), credential authorization (``credentials/authorize``
§11.8) and signing over an externally computed digest
(``signatures/signHash``, §11.13). §9 case 1 — single hash, per-signature
authorization — is the path every conforming provider SHALL support and the
path built here.

**The seam is the digest.** ``signHash`` takes base64 message digests and
returns base64 raw signatures in input order, which is exactly what a
``Signer.async_sign_raw`` implementation asks for. Nothing in this module
builds, reads or holds a PDF.

SCAL2 and the ordering problem
------------------------------
Under SCAL2 the Signature Activation Data is bound to THE HASHES BEING SIGNED
(§8.1.4), but a digest does not exist until the document's byte range is built,
which is after a signer is constructed. This module therefore takes the LAZY
option: :meth:`CscClient.authorize_and_sign` acquires the SAD at digest time,
with the hashes it is about to sign, and immediately spends it. The
alternative — a dry-run pass to obtain the digest, authorize, then sign for
real — doubles the document build and is not used. Under SCAL1 the
authorization is not hash-bound and the same call still holds, so one entry
point covers both levels.

Explicit authorization is REFUSED BY NAME
-----------------------------------------
§8.1.4 defines ``explicit`` credential authorization, where the signature
application collects a PIN or OTP in its own environment and transmits it as
``authData`` to ``credentials/authorize``. This client refuses that mode by
name and never accepts an ``authData`` value. The application's standing
credential posture is that the platform collects an authentication factor and
the application never sees it (the certificate-store source relies on Windows'
own consent UI for exactly this reason); a factor typed into this application
and forwarded to a third party is the opposite of that posture. Only
``oauth2code`` credentials are usable here, where the provider's own
authorization server collects the factor.

``signatures/signDoc`` is out of scope
--------------------------------------
That method hands the WHOLE DOCUMENT to the provider. That is a different
privacy posture from sending a digest, and it is deliberately not implemented
here rather than being smuggled in behind the same configuration.

Network posture
---------------
The HTTP client for ``/SubmitForm`` lives in Rust, where the DESTINATION
COMES FROM THE DOCUMENT and one audited client with an SSRF classifier is the
answer. This client is categorically different: its
destination is user-configured and a document can neither name nor influence
it. That is enforced structurally rather than by convention — **no method here
accepts a URL**. Every endpoint is derived from the base URI held in
:class:`CscConfig`, which is built from application settings, and even the
OAuth base the provider advertises in its own ``info`` response is required to
be same-origin with that configured base (a provider response is untrusted
bytes; letting it retarget the token endpoint would hand a hostile response the
user's authorization). There is therefore no path from document content to an
outbound request.

The transport rules: HTTPS only (plain HTTP refused by name — §7.3 forbids SSL
and expects TLS 1.2, and a signing credential over cleartext is
indefensible); TLS verification always on; redirects never followed, a redirect
response refused naming both hosts; no cookie jar, no environment proxies or
netrc, no credential store, a plain user agent; bounded connect and read
timeouts; a response body size cap; and no request is ever retried carrying
credentials.
