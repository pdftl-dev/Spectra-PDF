"""Comment/markup annotation overview and bulk delete.

The canvas edits the four annotation kinds it authors (Square/FreeText/Ink/
Stamp). This module works at the whole-document level over EVERY markup
annotation — including native Highlight/Underline/StrikeOut/Text/Link the editor
doesn't import inline — to (a) summarise what comments a document carries and
(b) delete them all. It is a
whole-file op: the renderer routes it through the snapshot/commit flow and
re-indexes afterward, so it never fights the inline annotation lifecycle.

Form fields (/Widget) and links (/Link) are not comments and are kept.
