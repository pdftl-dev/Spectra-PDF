    Pages copy via ``copy_pages_with_forms``, so every input's AcroForm
    fields stay registered and fillable — a plain ``pages.extend`` imports the
    field OBJECTS but not their registration, killing every form (pikepdf's
    own PageCopyWarning flags exactly this). Cross-file field-name collisions
    rename deterministically (``name+1``) and are reported as
    ``fields_renamed``; widget-less pure-data fields (which page-driven
    copying can't discover) and /SigFlags are handled by the acroform
    helpers. One annotation-copy batch per input preserves field identity
    across pages; the upstream per-page convenience loop splits shared fields.
