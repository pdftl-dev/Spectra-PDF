"""Pair-kerning read from a bundled face.

Every glyph we lay out advances by its own width alone, so an authored "AV"
or "To" sits visibly loose. This reads the face's own pair-kerning so the
emission can tighten those pairs the way a typesetter would.

SCOPE: wherever WE lay text out, sourced from whatever font that text
actually uses — the bundled Liberation family (authoring, convert, family
swap, per-span substitution) AND the document's own fonts, via their
embedded program or, failing that, their metric twin among the bundled
faces.

The document half is not a nicety. Kerning first shipped bundled-faces-only,
reasoning that byte-identity pins would break if every
emission kerned. That inverted the priority — the pins are an internal test
convention, a 1:1 feature set is the product requirement — and it left a
live regression standing: a paragraph whose original stream carried
`[(A) 74 (V) 74 (A) 55 (T) 40 (AR)] TJ` came back as a plain `Tj` after a
NO-OP re-type, so editing text visibly UN-KERNED it. Re-emitting without
kerning does not preserve the original kerning; it discards it. The pins
were updated to the corrected output.

Values are returned in 1000ths of an em — the unit PDF text space uses — so
callers never deal with a face's `unitsPerEm`.
