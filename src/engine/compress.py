"""PDF compression via Ghostscript, plus the MRC door for scanned documents.

`quality="mrc"` is the ONE door to the MRC pass (`engine/mrc.py`): the panel,
the CLI subcommand, `batch --operation compress`, the guided-actions step,
watched folders and scheduled runs all reach `compress`, so routing MRC
through the same op means every one of those surfaces gains it with no new
dispatch. A second entry point is how a surface gets left behind — the repo's
own "fixed four times at four dispatchers" lesson, applied before the fact.

        quality: One of 'screen', 'ebook', 'printer', 'prepress', or 'mrc'.
        dpi: Custom DPI (72-600). When set, overrides quality preset.
        gs_path: Path to the Ghostscript executable.
        mrc_preset: 'archival', 'balanced' or 'smallest' (mrc only).
        mrc_mask_codec: force a stencil codec by name (mrc only) — naming one
            that is unavailable REFUSES instead of silently substituting.
        mrc_bg_div: background downsample divisor override (mrc only).
        mrc_fg_div: foreground downsample divisor override (mrc only).
        mrc_pdfa_safe: keep every filter inside PDF/A-1's set (mrc only).
        mrc_verify_text: recognise the source page and the MRC page and revert
            any page whose text did not survive (mrc only).
        mrc_lang: recognition language for that check (mrc only).
        jbig2_path: explicit path to the vendored JBIG2 encoder (mrc only).
        tesseract_path: explicit path to the vendored recognizer; REQUIRED
            when `mrc_verify_text` is on (mrc only).
        font_dir: The bundled fallback faces, for regenerating the appearance
            of a widget that carries none whose value is outside the form
            font's encoding. Without it such a field keeps the appearance the
            producer synthesizes; every other field is unaffected.
        drop_encryption: The user was told the compression cannot keep the
            document's protection and chose to proceed. The output is
            unprotected and says so as `encryption_removed`.

    The `mrc_*` arguments are ignored on the Ghostscript branch, and `dpi` is
