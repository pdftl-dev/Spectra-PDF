"""Content-aware crop — trim a page box to what the page actually draws.

The manual crop takes per-edge insets. This one measures instead: it finds the
rectangle the page's own content occupies and writes THAT as the page box,
keeping an optional margin around it. Nothing is deleted — a page box is a
view boundary, and resetting it brings the margin back.

Two sources of a content rectangle, and which one applies is not a guess:

* A **scanned** page (``mrc._classify_page`` says so — the same single answer
  the scan-enhancement pass uses) has one big image covering it, so the union
  of its placements IS the whole page. The rectangle comes from INK instead:
  the placement's own samples, Sauvola-binarized, with speckle-sized specks
  dropped first so one dust mote in a corner cannot hold the margin open.
* A **born-digital** page is the union of what the existing listings already
  report — text runs, painted paths, image placements — plus the rectangles of
  annotations that draw something. Geometry the walk has found clipped away is
  excluded: it is not on the page.

The union is intersected with the page's current box; content outside the
visible box is already not shown and must not pull the crop back out.

A page with nothing on it is SKIPPED with a reason and keeps its full box: a
box around no content is a page a viewer shows as nothing. If no page in the
selection yielded a rectangle, the call refuses rather than writing an output
identical to its input.
