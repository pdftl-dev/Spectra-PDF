"""Cross-file text search over PDFs on disk (part 2).

The in-app Find searches the OPEN documents' index; this searches PDFs that are
NOT open, by path, so a user can grep a whole folder. It runs in the engine (off
the render thread) so a big folder — or a pathological regex — can't freeze the
UI, and it honours the SAME three advanced modes as the in-app search: regex,
case-sensitivity, whole-word.

Matching model mirrors the in-app index: each page's extracted text has its
whitespace collapsed to single spaces (so a spaced query matches across the
line breaks pdfminer emits, and a literal query behaves like the in-app one). A
literal query is regex-escaped; a regex query is compiled verbatim; whole-word
wraps `\\b(?:…)\\b`; case-insensitive unless `case_sensitive`. An invalid regex
is reported as an error, never raised.

Bounded + honest: at most `max_files` files and `max_hits_per_file` matching
pages per file are returned, and any truncation or per-file extraction failure
(encrypted/corrupt) is reported rather than silently dropped.
