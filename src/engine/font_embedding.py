"""Whether a font's program travels with the document — one answer, one place.

Two properties of the format make the naive read wrong, and both produced a
check that reported a pass it had not earned:

- a program lives on the descriptor under one of three keys, and a composite
  font keeps its descriptor on its DESCENDANT, so a walk that reads
  ``/FontDescriptor`` off the top-level font dict finds nothing on every
  Type0 font and cannot tell "no descriptor here" from "no program anywhere";
- a font dict that will not read is not evidence of embedding;
- a Type 3 font carries its glyph programs in its own dictionary, so no
  descriptor read applies to it and its answer comes from a separate rule
  (``type3_embedded``).

So the answer is tri-state. ``None`` is neither ``True`` nor ``False``:
reporting an unreadable font as embedded is a passing check the walk did not
earn, and reporting it as not embedded is a false failure on a document that
may be conforming. The caller reports the third state rather than folding it
into either answer.

    A Type 3 font holds its glyph descriptions as content streams under

    format defines no external Type 3 font program a document could reference

    construction, and no descriptor read applies to it.
