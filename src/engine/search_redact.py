"""Search and redact ONE file, by path -- the headless half of disk scope.

Composes two doors that already exist and re-implements neither: the matcher
and its glyph-accurate rectangles come from ``search_text_regions``, and the
write is either the font-measured redactor (``redact``) or the ``/Redact``
interchange writer (``save_redaction_marks``). Nothing here decides where a
rectangle is or what counts as a match.

There is no review step in a headless run, so this redacts EVERY hit the
request finds. The count is reported so a caller can say so.

The folder scope is NOT reimplemented here: guided actions already walk a
source tree, mirror it and run per-file ops on the copy, from the CLI and from
a scheduled task alike, so this is registered as a step and inherits it.
