"""Certificate-based (public-key) PDF encryption — the second half.

The standard security handler (encrypt.py) locks a document with passwords;
this module locks it to RECIPIENT CERTIFICATES (Adobe.PubSec, AES-256): any
holder of a listed certificate's private key opens the file — no shared
password to distribute. pikepdf/qpdf can neither read nor write this
handler (pikepdf raises a generic PdfError, not PasswordError), so both
directions run on pyHanko, which is already bundled for signing:

- ``encrypt_with_certs`` — copy the document into a fresh writer and attach
  a PubKeySecurityHandler (``encrypt_pubkey``). A REWRITE: encryption is a
  whole-file property, so existing signatures do not survive, exactly as
  with password encryption (the panel says so).
- ``decrypt_with_pfx`` — authenticate with a PKCS#12 bundle and rewrite
  plain. The open funnel uses this to unlock the working copy in place,
  mirroring the password path's ``unlock`` semantics.
- ``classify_encryption`` — none | password | pubkey, the open funnel's
  router. The pubkey sniff reads the trailer's /Encrypt /Filter through an
  unauthenticated pyHanko reader (probe-verified: the trailer of an
  Adobe.PubSec file is readable without credentials).

Permissions map from the same ``{print, copy, modify, annotate}`` contract
the standard encrypt exposes; assistive-technology access is never blocked.
