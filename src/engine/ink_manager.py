"""Ink Manager — aliasing, spot-to-process conversion, density and sequence.

**Aliasing is a name rewrite.** The separation device plates BY THE COLORANT
NAME, so two `/Separation` spaces that name one ink land on one plate the
moment they spell it the same way. The transform is element 1 of the
`/Separation` array, the matching entry of a `/DeviceN` `/Names` array, and
the key of its `/Attributes /Colorants` dictionary — nothing else.

**Aliasing two spaces whose tint transforms disagree changes the document's
appearance**, because the surviving name carries one transform and the
document had two. `compare_tint_transforms` measures the disagreement over
eleven tints; the applied door refuses without explicit consent.

**Spot to process is a content rewrite, not a whole-file conversion.** Every
`cs`/`scn` pair for the ink becomes the alternate space's operator with the
components its own tint transform produces; image samples convert through the
same transform; a shading's colour space is replaced and the transform is
composed onto its function. This is exact and it preserves vectors — unlike
the document-wide colour conversion, which is a different capability and stays
one.

**Composing onto a shading's function samples ONE input, so a shading whose
colour is not a function of one input cannot be converted that way.** Such a
shading is skipped IN PLACE — the colorant stays live in it — and named in the
result's `skipped` list, so the caller reads a partial conversion as partial.
One shading that cannot convert never refuses the whole operation, and it is
never converted anyway with colour the composition invented.

**A DeviceN converts whole or not at all.** Its components are painted
together through one transform, so there is no operator that could route one
component through the alternate and leave the rest in DeviceN. Converting any
component therefore converts the space, and the result names every colorant
that went with it.

**Neutral density and print sequence are not PDF keys.** No such entry exists
in any colour space or page dictionary, so they are stored as application
settings and drive exactly two things: how dark an ink renders in the
separation preview's composite, and the order the plates are listed in.
