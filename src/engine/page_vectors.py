"""Page-VECTOR editing.

Lists, selects (via a bbox), and deletes VECTOR path objects on a page — the
drawn rules, boxes, underlines, dividers, and logos that the raster
tools can't touch. A "vector object" is ONE maximal run of path-CONSTRUCTION
operators (`m l c v y re h`) terminated by a path-PAINTING operator that
DRAWS it (`f F f* S s B B* b b*`). It is the unit the user clicks.

Ids are the depth-first encounter order of PAINTED paths in the page content
stream — its OWN ordinal space, separate from `page_images`' — so the lister
and the delete rewriter agree by construction (both walk in encounter order,
the walker-agreement invariant).

What is NOT a vector object (v1 boundaries — refusals, never broken output):
  - A path terminated by `n` (end-path-no-op), or ANY path that sets a clip
    (`W`/`W*`): a clip region, not a drawn object. This is exactly the shape
    the crop frame emits (`re W n`), so the same rule keeps the tools' own
    frames from listing as phantom user objects. A clip-SETTING fill
    (`re W f`) is excluded too — deleting it would change the clipping of
    everything after it, which is more than "remove this object."
  - Paths inside Form XObjects — v1 lists PAGE-content paths only. Deleting
    into a shared form is copy-on-write complexity this pass
    does not need and will not half-pay for.
  - Shading (`sh`), images (`Do`), and text (shows) — not paths by
    definition.

Delete is strictly simpler than an image delete: DROP the target's
construction ops + its paint op from the page stream (leaving all surrounding
state — a neighbour's colour/CTM is never disturbed, exactly as the image
delete leaves the state around a dropped `Do`). No wrap, no XObject/resource
surgery; a `/Pattern`-filled path that becomes unreachable is swept by the
same `remove_unreferenced_resources` reachability pass the image family uses.

Named successors: vector move/resize/rotate (the image mirror — `matrix`
is listed for it, exactly as the image transform needs the image CTM),
then recolour / line-width, then form-nested paths.
