"""XFDF annotation interchange (rung 4 — ISO 19444-1's annots arm).

Exports a document's markup annotations to XFDF and imports an XFDF file's
annotations into a document. Geometry, colors, border width, opacity, author, dates,
subject, names, line endings, cloud intensity, callout leaders, quad points,
ink gestures — and the REVIEW THREAD: /IRT reply chains and /State
//StateModel (Accepted/Rejected/Completed/…) ride on `inreplyto`/`state`/
`statemodel`, so a round trip preserves who replied what to whom.

/IRT names a TARGET; /RT names the RELATIONSHIP, and they are separate
attributes here because they are separate facts. A reply and a group member
both point at one annotation and mean different things — a group moves, cuts
and copies as a unit — so an interchange that carried only `inreplyto` turned
every group into a reply thread. `replyType` carries the relationship, always,
including the default: a consuming tool then needs no knowledge of the default
to read this file correctly.

Relationship names outside the defined pair are TRANSCRIBED rather than
classified in both directions. An interchange's job is fidelity, and
transcribing asserts nothing the document does not hold. What cannot be
transcribed — a relationship that will not read, a target with no name to
reference — refuses BY NAME on both halves; the two sides of one interchange
behave the same way when they cannot tell.

Imported annotations carry no appearance streams. Viewers, including ours via
pdf.js, synthesize defaults or regenerate them on load. That is
the format's own convention, not a shortcut.

Both halves report what they leave behind, in one shape. A comment the export
cannot carry is a `skipped` record naming the page, the subtype and the reason;
a comment carried without one of its decorations is a `partial` record naming
the attribute. `found` counts the comments read and `count` the elements
written, so a caller can tell a whole export from a partial one without parsing
the file back. A malformed part of one annotation costs that annotation and
nothing else: an export that raises leaves the user no file at all, which is
the largest possible loss for the smallest possible fault.

What counts as a comment is `engine.annotations`'s markup set, so the panel's
listing and this export cannot disagree about the population. Widgets, links and
popups are not comments and are not reported as losses.
