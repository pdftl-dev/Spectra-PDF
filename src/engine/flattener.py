"""Transparency flattening by REGION.

Ghostscript's only transparency flattener rasterizes the whole page: thirty
lines of live text come back as a single 6120x7920 image carrying no fonts at
all. A raster/vector balance wired to that controls nothing, so the flatten
here is composed from primitives this engine already owns — an object walk that
says what a page paints and where, Ghostscript rasterizing ONE REGION at the
region's own scale, and the page rebuilt with that region's objects dropped and
the raster placed back.

**Region boundaries snap to whole device pixels.** A boundary that falls
mid-pixel makes the region raster resample, and the resampled edge draws a
visible seam against the live content beside it. Snapped, a flattened page
renders pixel-identical to the original; unsnapped at the same resolution the
same edge measures 128 levels of difference over hundreds of pixels.

**Every object intersecting a region is absorbed into it.** That is what makes
z-order irrelevant to the placement: absorbed objects are removed and the
raster is appended, and nothing still live overlaps the area it covers. The
raster/vector balance is the merge aggressiveness — toward vector, many small
regions and more live text survives; toward raster, fewer and larger ones.

    A text block's `drop_idxs` are its show operators and nothing else: the
    font, spacing and colour it sets outlive its ET, and the text after it
    draws in them. `without` removes a show and keeps its state effects.

    The second half is the page's UNKNOWN reasons, deduplicated in encounter
    order. A page that carries one cannot be flattened honestly: the flatten
    refuses by name and the classification reports the same sentence.

    The unit is deliberately PAGE-level: a form's interior is not addressed,
    because a region flatten removes whole objects and a half-removed form
    would draw its remainder through a raster that already contains it.
