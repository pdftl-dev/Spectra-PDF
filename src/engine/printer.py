"""Print a PDF to a Windows printer via Ghostscript's mswinpr2 device.

Same arm's-length-subprocess posture as compress/grayscale/PDF-A (the AGPL
boundary is the process boundary). mswinpr2 renders through the installed
Windows printer driver, so anything the driver can print, this can.

The operation supports the full print dialog: subset, reverse, collate, duplex,
paper size, orientation, color, comments modes, print-as-image, and the
layout modes (multiple-per-sheet, booklet, poster, custom scale). Two
mechanism families implement it:

- DRIVER (DEVMODE) options ride the job's Ghostscript switches. Duplex is
  the standard page-device pair (-dDuplex/-dTumble -> dmDuplex; documented
  for mswinpr2). Paper / orientation / color / document name go through the
  device's /UserSettings dictionary via a setpagedevice prolog — the old
  ``finddevice putdeviceprops`` incantation is REMOVED in gs 10.x
  (probe-verified); setpagedevice forwards because mswinpr2 exports
  /UserSettings. The key->DEVMODE mapping (Paper->dmPaperSize,
  Orientation->dmOrientation, Color->dmColor) is source-verified against
  the bundled 10.07.1. Paper TRAY selection is NOT possible on this device
  (dmDefaultSource is hard-forced to automatic in gdevwpr2.c) — reported as
  blocked-external, not silently faked.
- PAGE-LEVEL options (order, subsets, duplication, annotation modes,
  flatten/rasterize, imposition) build a temporary, exactly-prepared PDF in
  print_layout.py and print THAT verbatim — deterministic on every driver.

Copies are printed as N sequential Ghostscript jobs when collated: the
UserSettings /Copies key exists but rides dmCopies, which a driver that
ignores it silently turns into ONE copy — N identical jobs are deterministic
on every driver and arrive collated by construction. Uncollated copies
duplicate pages (1,1,2,2,...) into the prepared file instead — one job.
The N-job trade-off is N renders; explicit and bounded.

DEVMODE effects cannot be integration-tested headlessly (every dialog-free
printer on a dev box is either real paper or raises a file prompt), so the
switch/prolog strings are pinned byte-exact by unit tests, the key mapping
is source-verified, and everything renderable is proven through raster
devices with the same switch lists (TestPrintFitSemantics and friends).

All print renders pass -dUseCropBox: the CropBox is what the viewer shows,
and printing the MediaBox of a cropped document would silently print
content the user cannot see.
