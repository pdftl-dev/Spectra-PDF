/**
 * WebdriverIO config for Spectra PDF end-to-end tests.
 *
 * Runs against the debug build of the Tauri binary, driven by tauri-driver
 * which proxies to msedgedriver to control the embedded WebView2.
 *
 * WebView2 is Chromium-based and Windows Update bumps it roughly monthly —
 * msedgedriver only talks to the exact major version it was built for, so
 * ANY pinned copy (a stale `cargo install`-managed global, or a checked-in
 * binary) goes stale on its own schedule, not ours. There is no version to
 * pin here, minimum or otherwise: `onPrepare` below always re-resolves the
 * driver against whatever WebView2 is installed RIGHT NOW, by re-running
 * `msedgedriver-tool` at the start of every run. `--native-driver` then
 * points tauri-driver at that freshly-resolved copy instead of trusting PATH
 * to already have a correctly-versioned one.
 *
 * Prereqs (one-time per machine):
 *   cargo install tauri-driver --locked
 *   cargo install --git https://github.com/chippers/msedgedriver-tool
 *
 * Build the app harness with (from the repo root):
 *   VITE_E2E=1 npx tauri build --debug --no-bundle --features e2e-net-private
 *
 * The feature compiles in the loopback carve-out the network spec needs
 * (src-tauri/src/net.rs); a build without it ignores SPECTRA_NET_ALLOW_PRIVATE
 * and SPECTRAPDF_E2E for network policy, which is how a release artifact is
 * kept incapable of the bypass.
 *
 * NOT with a bare `cargo build`: tauri-build re-runs whenever dist changes,
 * and outside the tauri CLI it bakes a DEV context into the binary — the
 * webview then points at http://localhost:5173 (no dev server = blank page)
 * and every spec fails with "Test harness never appeared on window". CDP's
 * /json endpoint exposes the incorrect localhost URL for diagnosis.
 *
 * Then: npm test
