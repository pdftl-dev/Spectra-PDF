 * (1) `editParagraphOpen` is fire-and-forget: it returns void whether or not
 * the editor mounted, so `open(); waitForDisplayed()` is check-then-act. A
 * reindex still in flight from a previous test's undo lands just after the open
 * and re-renders the editor away, and the wait then burns its whole timeout on
 * an editor that was opened once and closed.
 *
 * (2) **Page ids are generation-tagged, so a retry that reuses the caller's id
 * can never recover.** That is not a theory: hardening (1) alone turned the
 * v1.0.20 battery's opaque `edit-para-input still not displayed after 10000ms`
 * into a reproducible `never stayed open for …pdf#g4#p0 paragraph 0` — twenty
 * seconds of re-opening a RETIRED id. The reindex that fires between the
 * caller's listing read and the open publishes generation g+1 and drops g, and
 * by design a stale id can never re-bind. Therefore
 * the id is re-read inside the predicate, exactly as spec 43's convert case had
 * already learned to do locally.
 *
 * Living here means the ~30 call sites across specs
 * 43/49/50/52/54/55/56/57/98/109/110 are covered rather than the one that
 * happened to lose the race — the same reason `openMenuItem` exists.
