/**
 * An app Exit that nobody cancels, and the launch that reads what it left.
 *
 * 147 drives the exit that is called OFF. This is its complement: the exit that
 * goes through. Three properties only this shape can show.
 *
 * The first is that a two-window Exit closes both windows and records both.
 * The capture is taken while every window still stands, because each window's
 * destruction writes that window out of the record — a capture taken one
 * destruction later can only ever describe the window that closed last.
 *
 * The second is the receipt. Nothing closes until every other window has
 * acknowledged the request, and a request that is not acknowledged calls the
 * quit off with a notice. The abort half is not drivable from here — it needs a
 * renderer that hears nothing, and a renderer this suite can reach is a
 * renderer that answers — so what is asserted is the ordinary verdict: the
 * windows go, which is only reachable through `request_quit` answering true.
 *
 * The third is the launch. A session saved with the main window already closed
 * has no main-kind record, and treating every record as an extra opens an EMPTY
 * main window beside the ones that were actually saved. The first record adopts
 * the slot instead, so the relaunch shows one window — the one that was saved.
 *
 * Two of those cases end with the app exiting, which ends the driver's session
 * with it. `browser.reloadSession()` is what makes them fit in one file: it
 * hands tauri-driver a fresh session, and tauri-driver launches the binary
 * again — which is also the only way the launch case can be driven at all,
 * since the thing under test is what a NEW process does with the file.
 *
 * `session.json` is read with Node's `fs`: it is written entirely on the Rust
 * side, and asking a renderer about it would only prove what the renderer
 * believes. The staging file beside it is read the same way — a write that
 * lands by rename leaves nothing behind, and the check is that nothing is
 * there. The data root outlives every session of the suite, and the harness
 * ends a session by terminating the app, which can land between a staged
 * write and its rename. A staging file whose process is gone is therefore
 * removed before this spec's first check: it is not a write this spec drove.
