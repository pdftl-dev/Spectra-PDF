/**
 * Dragging a document tab from one workspace window into another.
 *
 * The gesture belongs to the source renderer and the geography belongs to
 * Rust: a held pointer keeps delivering to the window it started in, so the
 * source can follow the cursor anywhere but cannot say whose tab strip is
 * under it, nor who owns the document afterwards. Both answers come from the
 * strip registry and the claim table.
 *
 * A real cross-window drag needs OS-level input — injected synthetics are
 * renderer-local and never establish the capture the gesture depends on — so
 * the seam sits directly above the pointer: `tabDragDrop` is the function
 * pointerup calls, with the release point supplied, and `tabDragTrack` is the
 * call a throttled move makes. Everything below them (commit gate, resolution,
 * claim handover, the tab close, the target's open funnel) is the shipped
 * path. Escape is the one case driven as a real gesture, because only a live
 * arm state owns the key; it stays inside one window, since what crosses is
 * the tracked point rather than the pointer.
 *
 * **A tear-off comes first because it is the only way a spec can place a
 * window.** Every workspace window is built centred at one size, so two of
 * them stack exactly and their strips share every point — where the source
 * window wins by design, and no drop can ever reach the other. Dropping on
 * empty space puts the second window at a point of this spec's choosing, and
 * every later case aims at the strip that lands there.
 *
 * The caret case is the runtime cross-check the A2 probe could not finish on
 * this box: the offset Rust computes from its own registry is compared with
 * where the TARGET window's DOM says its strip is. Scaled and mixed-DPI
 * equality of `scale_factor` and `devicePixelRatio` is assumed throughout this
 * feature; this is where that assumption fails loudly if it ever breaks.
 *
 * What geometry can be driven from here, and what cannot: a tear-off performs
 * a real `set_position`, so the geometry case asserts the rectangle a window
 * was actually placed at against the file. A LIVE window can be neither moved
 * nor resized — the driver commands the WebView2 content, not the host window
 * (`setWindowRect` returns without touching it), and no command or harness
 * seam resizes a window. A relaunch cannot be asserted either: quitting seals
 * the file from the live windows, so a planted rectangle never survives to be
 * restored, and the only rectangle a relaunch could restore is the centred one
 * a fresh launch produces anyway. The placement arithmetic those cases would
 * exercise — the monitor-gone clamp, the work-area centring, what the
 * preference gates — is pinned by the Rust unit tests instead.
